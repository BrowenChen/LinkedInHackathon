    "FIELD4":"[u'What\\'s not to love? Greasy burgers and fries, heavy creamy milkshakes. Definitely a belt busting burger Mecca.\\n\\nNot a superb culinary experience, but a fun one I would recommend anyone try at least once. I like getting my burger \"protein style\" which is a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.', u'I have not been to In-N-Out too much recently, but last night I chose to walk all the way to this one on Grant Rd and I remember why I used to love it so much.\\n\\nEven though the toppings are just plain lettuce and tomatoes they are incredibly fresh. Other restaurants might use fancier lettuce and better sauces now, but there is something to be said for the freshness of In-N-Out.\\n\\nI went with a Triple Meat (3x0) with ketchup instead. I think that\\'s healthier than most other things... no cheese, no lame \"special sauce\". Just good burgers. The best part is the additional patties are pretty cheap. You can only go up to four patties on a burger, though years ago when they first got big people did things like 100x100 but they cut it down to 4x4 due to health concerns.\\n\\nIn-N-Out is great and this location is better than most. The sodas don\\'t taste weird here like they do in Santa Clara.\\n\\nOne thing though.. the wait will be longer than most fast food places. In terms of both quality of the food and the wait time In-N-Out is sort of between fast food and a sit-down place. While at McDonald\\'s or Burger King you can get your food within 5 minutes, In-N-out it might take 10. This is partially because I choose to order things like the 3x0 rather than the normal menu items.\\n\\nOne minor annoyance: Little kid slowing down the line paying for like 4 people with cash. I wish parents would stop doing this so much especially if it\\'s busy. Sure, you\\'re teaching your kid the value of money and encouraging them to go and order your food... but it slows the world down.\\n\\nOkay, that\\'s just me though. Thank god In-N-out takes credit cards now. Back in 2005 they didn\\'t... up until August or so. Everyone should accept credit cards, if they do not, they don\\'t deserve my money.', u\"Love this in n out! It's usually packed, at the drive thru and inside but no surprise there.\\nIn the like 30 times I've come to this location, they've only messed up once. That to me, is exceptional.\\nI love their fries! Damn their fries! I like to get extra onions, no cheese, and ask to put in the spread myself. I just like to have it the way I'd like it that day with the amount of spread. Once they drowned my fries in spread so I learned that I'd rather do it myself.\\nThe quality is nice for a fast food place and the customer service is always nice and  hard working.\", u'So delicious! Closely to where I live they are always very friendly however sometimes there are very long lines at drive thru and it takes quite a while. There are certain items not listed on menu outside which is pretty bizarre. But pricier than other places but worth it. Tastes so fresh and I like how they cut the potatoes fresh everyday.', u\"Came by for a light dinner the other night and managed to park at the office building behind In N Out with no problem! Ordering was easy and the employee was wearing his uniform with name tag.\\n\\n2 x 1 with onions protein style came out very nicely. Lettuce was fresh and so was the rest of my burger, patty and onions!\\n\\nFries were perfect this time around too! ...they tend to get cold quickly so it's best to start with fries first and then move on to the burger!\\n\\nKetchup is available at the condiment counter and is served chilled!\\n\\n~$5.5 for a light dinner!\", u\"This location has slow service and average food, but at least they stay open late...\\n\\nThe Service: The young man who took my order was very nice, so A+ to him. The problem came while I was waiting for my food. A total of three different customers received their food before I did, and they were behind me in line. Having to wait between 12-15 minutes to receive two items is ridiculous at a fast-food restaurant, especially when the inside of the restaurant was only 40% full on the night I went.\\n\\nThe Food: I ordered a double-double with a side of fries, both were animal style. I had no complaints with the burger; however, the onions on the fries were clearly burnt and tasted gross. If you look at the picture that's attached to this review, you can clearly see a dark/black patch near the top section of the fries; those were the burnt onions. If I had more time, I would've asked for a replacement, but I already had to wait long for my initial order, so I didn't bother.\\n\\nConclusion: While the burgers are decent at this location, the terrible fries and length of time I had to wait to receive my food really annoyed me. I'll stick to the Sunnyvale location for future In-N-Out Burger cravings.\", u\"We have been here a few times for a quick bite on the go. Each time its always packed. Even when they're at their busiest. They still give customers fast service. Unlike other in-n-outs around the bay where you have to wait 15 to 20 min or longer for your food. Not this burger joint. This is definitely my favorite In-N-Out.\\n\\nAmazing service and delicious burgers!\", u\"I don't eat fast food anymore, I gotta start with that.  My GF wanted a double double and animal fries and I'm more than happy to take her.  Restaurant was clean, employees were friendly, service was decent overall.\\nShe was happy with the burger, apprently the fries were only 'ok'.\\nIt's a once or twice a year craving for her so I guess we'll be back in a few months.\", u'I Love this place always friendly staff.,\\nin and out are the best burgers in America, for 7 bucks', u'Huge fan of coming to this burger joint when it\\'s late at night and the tummy is grumbling. You always get service with a smile here, no matter what time you come. The greeter at the drive-through line is pleasant and really helps to expedite the ordering process. So far, they\\'ve never gotten my order wrong, and the \"to go\" packaging is clean and neat. I get everything \"animal style\"- fries and burger. It\\'s nice that they have the healthier protein style version, without the bun. Still tasty, but minus the extra carbs and calories. Good combo. The milkshake is quite sweet, and it fills you up fast. This place is great for those late night cravings.', u\"Okay ... Who doesn't like in and out?!??!??!? We don't have this in Colorado!!!every family member and friend that I have visit me here always wants to go to in and out!! Since this is the closets to my home! I Iove it! and the fact that their open until 1 am!! is even better. The burgers are devine and the animal fries are danm awesome!!!!!\", u'Whether it\\'s the little red palm trees or the tangy special spread, I\\'m not sure. What I do know is I absolutely love In-N-Out Burger. No matter where I go (LA, SD, SF, SB) the \"#2 spread only\" is consistently delicious. Why give this place four stars and not five? Upon getting food from this location tonight I was served exceptionally crispy fries. Were they delicious when doused in special sauce? Yes, but too crispy nonetheless.\\n\\nOn a brighter note, other things I like about every In-N-Out:\\n- Consistenly friendly service\\n- They have never messed up my order\\n- High Quality food\\n- Inexpensive prices\\n- Clean atmosphere\\n- Free stickers :)', u\"I have only done drive through because I feel like that's how it supposed to be done.  I remember when I was in college driving to SoCal to have these infamous burgers and, of course, the bumper stickers.  \\n\\nWith all of the gross stuff we hear about in our fast food, this is solid. Fries are ok ... Burgers are small but great. Driving lines can be long but they work really hard to combat that.  \\n\\nThe bible verses hidden on the plates and cups are weird. Really weird.\\n\\nLove the diaper pins.  If you go there you will see\", u'A few bucks for a gourmet burger and fries? And free lemon slices for my cup of water?\\n\\nYes please.\\n\\nNot a bad burger. Juicy even without added sauce. Next time I\\'ll skip the \"well done\" fries from the secret menu in favor of the normal fries. The well done fries are crispier, but maybe a little too crispy, and lose some of the natural potato flavor in exchange for more calories.\\n\\nPoint is, the wonderful workers here will make it for you the way you ask. All served with a smile. Somebody even came by after and took my trash for me.\\n\\nParking and seating are ample. Restrooms are even kept clean.\\n\\nYou guys are too good to me.', u'Who would give ratings below 5 stars? In n out is legend. Thank you for your wonderful service.', u'We frequently visit this eatery since my kids love in-n-out. The food is great, staff are friendly and the place is clean.', u'I enjoy in-n-out, I really do, but I was extremely disappointed with the service here. Two friends ordered fries (animal style) separately. We waited and noticed that the large group of kids that came in about five to seven minutes after us had received their burgers and fries before us. We continued to wait, hoping that our fres would eventually come out. 57, 59, 63, 66. Nope, nothing. We were number 52 and 53 (again different registers). We asked about our orders. We had hoped it would be some of the next few orders of fries that were coming out. Nope again. Another 10 minutes and we finally get our food. Nearly 30 minutes for two orders of french fries. The disappointment was real.', u\"Talk about a delicious cheat meal. Always consistent in taste and quality. A mouth orgasm if I say so myself. Good service and a clean positive atmosphere.  It's a good thing I don't live around the corner because I'd occupy frequently and become obese!\", u'Have never gave one of my favorite spots to eat a one star review. The food at this place is amazing but unfortunately when I tried to order I was denied service because my order was \"too large\" and she didn\\'t want to deal with it....\\n\\nI came in after the Drake and Lil wayne concert ten minutes before the closed and asked if they were closed. The person at the register told me no and when my friends and I order 12 cheeseburgers the lady who was the manager on duty at the time told the person at the register that they wouldn\\'t take that order and that it was too late and she didn\\'t want to deal with it.....the doors were not even locked yet and the lady manager was beyond rude.\\n\\nThe whole situation was a Damn shame because In n Out has a reputation for having amazing employees and outstanding customer service. I work in the area and my company spends about $300 there a WEEK! Not anymore though it\\'s really sad that I have to settle for other options.  The date I came in was 9/16', u\"I use to love this place until their french fries stopped tasting fresh. Now they are very dry  :(\\nOverall the service is nice and the location is pretty clean. The bathroom are also well maintained. i usually sit down at this location.\\nAnd the food went from 10/10 to 9/10 but it's still pretty good!\", u'Love In and Out Burger- however- this franchise on El Camino Real in Mountain View, CA has the SLOWEST drive thru ever for such a limited menu. Ridiculous.', u\"It's in n out what can I say?  The food was delicious, the fries were fresh, and the order came out pretty fast.\", u'This specific joint was mediocre at best.', u'Alex was so friendly! He made genuine conversation after taking our order. He was great and deserves a raise!', u\"There's something about In-N-Out that makes me crave it whenever I need a late night snack/meal and now that I think about it, it's my go to place for that situation!\\n\\nIn-N-Outs menu is very simple offering a hamburger, cheeseburger, or a double cheeseburger. It's quite cheap too but the quality is very very good and I prefer eating these burgers than restaurant burgers by far. The nice toasted bun and tasty ingredients are to crave for! Despite the misleading limited menu, there's actually a lot of customizations here you can do and my favorite is:\\n\\nCheeseburger\\nWhole grilled onions\\nBurger cut in half\\n\\nWith the fries!\", u\"Slow service , waited almost 10 minutes and that wasn't why I have them two stars.\\nSandwich was Ok , already semi cold when I got it but eatable. Fries on the other side where among the worst I had, tasteless and dry . Until today I taught McDonald's was bad but Inn and out proved me wrong.\\nBTW this was my first and last time there.\", u\"In n out burgers and fries are consistently delicious. Especially with the smell of carmelized onions teasing your nose every time you drive or walk by. This time I ordered animal fries, which was a first for me...it was too rich and filling. It was good, but probably better eaten at the location bc once I got home, the cheese had hardened a little. $3.50 was a bit pricey for just fries, cheese, sauce and onions. I think the double cheeseburger is less. In any case, I'll just stick to fries and a burger\", u\"Wow I was from out of the area and it wasn't crowded?? Any time I've ever been to in and out burger they're packed always.\\n\\nI believe these employees still have good in them but they are unchallenged. Going soft and lazy. There was a period of time when nobody was getting any food at all. nobody was moving around. Very odd.\\n\\nAnd you know how every iemployee you've ever seen there is super happy?? Like freaky happy? Like it's their birthday and it's Christmas and Jesus just gave them a blowjob?\\n\\nOne of the guys there seem like he was at regular job!!!! Almost barked an order or two at a few people! I tell you what people, if in and out falls, that's it. Game over man!\", u'For a fast food burger In Out is the best.\\n\\nBurgers are always moist, well cooked and consistent .  Fries are real. Wait time is short. I also like they pay their staff a living wage.', u\"I work right across the street from this In-N-Out and I'll come here a couple times a month to grab a burger for lunch. Really clean location, friendly staff and positive atmosphere. The food is delicious (as usual). I still give them 5 stars even though sometimes it's taken 15 minutes to get my order. It's a very busy location and even with a full staff you should still expect a little bit of a wait. Keep it up!!\", u'There is no other burger joint chain I enjoy more. Simple, consistent, and tasty. My personal favorite is the double double with no tomatoes and no onion. Fries well done.', u\"Ok, I've come to appreciate In-n-Out.  I was never a hater, but the thin burger just didn't do it for me.    Until I learned about the off menu items, which made a big difference for me.\\n\\nI get the burger, grilled-onion, protein-style wrapped in lettuce and extra crispy french fries with cheese.  Be warned adding cheese to the fries more than doubles the price of them, but it's really good.. you can ask for a packets of banana peppers and make nacho fries.  \\n\\nThe shakes are really awesome, but I can't get everything at once cos just too full.\", u\"Service was good.  The bathrooms were clean.  But still not impressed with the food.  \\n\\nIt surprisingly wasn't too busy for a Sunday afternoon....but overall it could've had better food\", u\"When I feel the urge to indulge my pesco-vegetarian cravings - grilled cheese animal style, well-done fries, water w/lemon, and/or a neopolitan shake.\\n\\nThis location is pretty good at maintaining efficiency, but cleanliness is a bit lax. Snapped a photo of a fella who dropped fries on a non-food surface and put them right back into someone's drive-thru to-go bag.\\n\\nCalled him out, not sure if anything was done about it.\", u\"If you are going to get fast food, you better get In-N-Out burger, since it is hands down the best fast food that you can get (and it is so so sooo affordable).  Clearly, I'm a big fan.\\n\\nIf it's your first time coming to In-N-Out, you should get a double double with animal style fries and a milkshake.  Yes, you will feel like you are going to explode after your meal, but it is worth it. :)\", u\"Meh. It's alright; not bad for fast food. The buns are toasted, which I appreciated. The patty is very thin with not a lot of flavor or texture. The fries aren't any good unless smothered in animal style and attacked with a fork. And this branch at least was quite dirty.\\nCheap, yes, so I wouldn't expect too much.\\n\\nDear fellow East Coasters curious what all the hype is about, Five Guys, is better. Much better. More expensive, but overall better quality. FG fries wins by a landslide, and I'll give them the patty and the toppings as well. The only thing that In n Out does better, is toast their buns.\", u'Near the hospital.. thank goodness.\\n\\nMy friend had a baby and her husband desperately wanted food. No Panda Express in sight so of course near a hospital there are tons of fast food options!!!! Long line in drive thru but it went quickly. Order was correct and the process was not painful. A double double animal style with animal style fries and a shake later I was on my way.', u'In-N-Out always has a place in my heart for their Animal Style burgers and fries. Burgers and fries here are made fresh and I always leave here satisfied. To top things off, the milk shakes at In-N-Out are always to die for. Neopolitan shakes are secret and off the menu, but oh so delicious :)\\n\\nWhen it comes to Animal Style fries, I\\'m not a huge fan of lots of cheese so you can always ask them to make your animal style fries without any cheese. And if you want more secret sauce to add to your burger or fries, you can ask them for individual packets :D If you\\'re feeling healthy and want to limit the amount of carbs in your burger, getting your burger or cheeseburger \"protein-style\" replaces the buns with lettuce. The result is a lighter, but just as delicious burger without all the carbs from your typical bread buns.', u\"No matter what trendy burger joint opens up I always go there to try their burgers but in the end I always end up going back to In-N-Out. Five guys... got nothing on In-N-Out. Their burger is way too heavy and greasy. Habit - nice and tasty. Not as heavy and Five guys but still more expensive than In-N-Out. For the price and taste I'm going  Cheeseburger animal style all day every day.\\nThis location is the most consistent than the other one in Mountain View.\", u\"Just another in-n-out burger.  The franchise is great, and the burgers are great.\\n\\nThe food... just like any other In-N-Out burger.  I don't think there's anything of note about this store than any others.  The burgers are good, the service is average, etc...\\n\\nThe only thing I'll say about this venue over any of the others is that the intersection here can get very very congested around lunch/dinner.  If you're coming down 237 stick to the right lane and you might be able to bypass some of the traffic.  On El Camino, you don't really have any good options.\", u'What\\'s not to love? Greasy burgers and fries, heavy creamy milkshakes. Definitely a belt busting burger Mecca.\\n\\nNot a superb culinary experience, but a fun one I would recommend anyone try at least once. I like getting my burger \"protein style\" which is a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.', u'I have not been to In-N-Out too much recently, but last night I chose to walk all the way to this one on Grant Rd and I remember why I used to love it so much.\\n\\nEven though the toppings are just plain lettuce and tomatoes they are incredibly fresh.

It was good, but probably better eaten at the location bc once I got home, the cheese had hardened a little. $3.50 was a bit pricey for just fries, cheese, sauce and onions. I think the double cheeseburger is less. In any case, I'll just stick to fries and a burger\", u\"Wow I was from out of the area and it wasn't crowded?? Any time I've ever been to in and out burger they're packed always.\\n\\nI believe these employees still have good in them but they are unchallenged. Going soft and lazy. There was a period of time when nobody was getting any food at all. nobody was moving around. Very odd.\\n\\nAnd you know how every iemployee you've ever seen there is super happy?? Like freaky happy? Like it's their birthday and it's Christmas and Jesus just gave them a blowjob?\\n\\nOne of the guys there seem like he was at regular job!!!! Almost barked an order or two at a few people! I tell you what people, if in and out falls, that's it. Game over man!\", u'For a fast food burger In Out is the best.\\n\\nBurgers are always moist, well cooked and consistent .  Fries are real. Wait time is short. I also like they pay their staff a living wage.', u\"I work right across the street from this In-N-Out and I'll come here a couple times a month to grab a burger for lunch. Really clean location, friendly staff and positive atmosphere. The food is delicious (as usual). I still give them 5 stars even though sometimes it's taken 15 minutes to get my order. It's a very busy location and even with a full staff you should still expect a little bit of a wait. Keep it up!!\", u'There is no other burger joint chain I enjoy more. Simple, consistent, and tasty. My personal favorite is the double double with no tomatoes and no onion. Fries well done.', u\"Ok, I've come to appreciate In-n-Out.  I was never a hater, but the thin burger just didn't do it for me.    Until I learned about the off menu items, which made a big difference for me.\\n\\nI get the burger, grilled-onion, protein-style wrapped in lettuce and extra crispy french fries with cheese.  Be warned adding cheese to the fries more than doubles the price of them, but it's really good.. you can ask for a packets of banana peppers and make nacho fries.  \\n\\nThe shakes are really awesome, but I can't get everything at once cos just too full.\", u\"Service was good.  The bathrooms were clean.  But still not impressed with the food.  \\n\\nIt surprisingly wasn't too busy for a Sunday afternoon....but overall it could've had better food\", u\"When I feel the urge to indulge my pesco-vegetarian cravings - grilled cheese animal style, well-done fries, water w/lemon, and/or a neopolitan shake.\\n\\nThis location is pretty good at maintaining efficiency, but cleanliness is a bit lax. Snapped a photo of a fella who dropped fries on a non-food surface and put them right back into someone's drive-thru to-go bag.\\n\\nCalled him out, not sure if anything was done about it.\", u\"If you are going to get fast food, you better get In-N-Out burger, since it is hands down the best fast food that you can get (and it is so so sooo affordable).  Clearly, I'm a big fan.\\n\\nIf it's your first time coming to In-N-Out, you should get a double double with animal style fries and a milkshake.  Yes, you will feel like you are going to explode after your meal, but it is worth it. :)\", u\"Meh. It's alright; not bad for fast food. The buns are toasted, which I appreciated. The patty is very thin with not a lot of flavor or texture. The fries aren't any good unless smothered in animal style and attacked with a fork. And this branch at least was quite dirty.\\nCheap, yes, so I wouldn't expect too much.\\n\\nDear fellow East Coasters curious what all the hype is about, Five Guys, is better. Much better. More expensive, but overall better quality. FG fries wins by a landslide, and I'll give them the patty and the toppings as well. The only thing that In n Out does better, is toast their buns.\", u'Near the hospital.. thank goodness.\\n\\nMy friend had a baby and her husband desperately wanted food. No Panda Express in sight so of course near a hospital there are tons of fast food options!!!! Long line in drive thru but it went quickly. Order was correct and the process was not painful. A double double animal style with animal style fries and a shake later I was on my way.', u'In-N-Out always has a place in my heart for their Animal Style burgers and fries. Burgers and fries here are made fresh and I always leave here satisfied. To top things off, the milk shakes at In-N-Out are always to die for. Neopolitan shakes are secret and off the menu, but oh so delicious :)\\n\\nWhen it comes to Animal Style fries, I\\'m not a huge fan of lots of cheese so you can always ask them to make your animal style fries without any cheese. And if you want more secret sauce to add to your burger or fries, you can ask them for individual packets :D If you\\'re feeling healthy and want to limit the amount of carbs in your burger, getting your burger or cheeseburger \"protein-style\" replaces the buns with lettuce. The result is a lighter, but just as delicious burger without all the carbs from your typical bread buns.', u\"No matter what trendy burger joint opens up I always go there to try their burgers but in the end I always end up going back to In-N-Out. Five guys... got nothing on In-N-Out. Their burger is way too heavy and greasy. Habit - nice and tasty. Not as heavy and Five guys but still more expensive than In-N-Out. For the price and taste I'm going  Cheeseburger animal style all day every day.\\nThis location is the most consistent than the other one in Mountain View.\", u\"Just another in-n-out burger.  The franchise is great, and the burgers are great.\\n\\nThe food... just like any other In-N-Out burger.  I don't think there's anything of note about this store than any others.  The burgers are good, the service is average, etc...\\n\\nThe only thing I'll say about this venue over any of the others is that the intersection here can get very very congested around lunch/dinner.  If you're coming down 237 stick to the right lane and you might be able to bypass some of the traffic.  On El Camino, you don't really have any good options.\", u'What\\'s not to love? Greasy burgers and fries, heavy creamy milkshakes. Definitely a belt busting burger Mecca.\\n\\nNot a superb culinary experience, but a fun one I would recommend anyone try at least once. I like getting my burger \"protein style\" which is a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.', u'I have not been to In-N-Out too much recently, but last night I chose to walk all the way to this one on Grant Rd and I remember why I used to love it so much.\\n\\nEven though the toppings are just plain lettuce and tomatoes they are incredibly fresh. Other restaurants might use fancier lettuce and better sauces now, but there is something to be said for the freshness of In-N-Out.\\n\\nI went with a Triple Meat (3x0) with ketchup instead. I think that\\'s healthier than most other things... no cheese, no lame \"special sauce\". Just good burgers. The best part is the additional patties are pretty cheap. You can only go up to four patties on a burger, though years ago when they first got big people did things like 100x100 but they cut it down to 4x4 due to health concerns.\\n\\nIn-N-Out is great and this location is better than most. The sodas don\\'t taste weird here like they do in Santa Clara.\\n\\nOne thing though.. the wait will be longer than most fast food places. In terms of both quality of the food and the wait time In-N-Out is sort of between fast food and a sit-down place. While at McDonald\\'s or Burger King you can get your food within 5 minutes, In-N-out it might take 10. This is partially because I choose to order things like the 3x0 rather than the normal menu items.\\n\\nOne minor annoyance: Little kid slowing down the line paying for like 4 people with cash. I wish parents would stop doing this so much especially if it\\'s busy. Sure, you\\'re teaching your kid the value of money and encouraging them to go and order your food... but it slows the world down.\\n\\nOkay, that\\'s just me though. Thank god In-N-out takes credit cards now. Back in 2005 they didn\\'t... up until August or so. Everyone should accept credit cards, if they do not, they don\\'t deserve my money.', u\"Love this in n out! It's usually packed, at the drive thru and inside but no surprise there.\\nIn the like 30 times I've come to this location, they've only messed up once. That to me, is exceptional.\\nI love their fries! Damn their fries! I like to get extra onions, no cheese, and ask to put in the spread myself. I just like to have it the way I'd like it that day with the amount of spread. Once they drowned my fries in spread so I learned that I'd rather do it myself.\\nThe quality is nice for a fast food place and the customer service is always nice and  hard working.\", u'So delicious! Closely to where I live they are always very friendly however sometimes there are very long lines at drive thru and it takes quite a while. There are certain items not listed on menu outside which is pretty bizarre. But pricier than other places but worth it. Tastes so fresh and I like how they cut the potatoes fresh everyday.', u\"Came by for a light dinner the other night and managed to park at the office building behind In N Out with no problem! Ordering was easy and the employee was wearing his uniform with name tag.\\n\\n2 x 1 with onions protein style came out very nicely. Lettuce was fresh and so was the rest of my burger, patty and onions!\\n\\nFries were perfect this time around too! ...they tend to get cold quickly so it's best to start with fries first and then move on to the burger!\\n\\nKetchup is available at the condiment counter and is served chilled!\\n\\n~$5.5 for a light dinner!\", u\"This location has slow service and average food, but at least they stay open late...\\n\\nThe Service: The young man who took my order was very nice, so A+ to him. The problem came while I was waiting for my food. A total of three different customers received their food before I did, and they were behind me in line. Having to wait between 12-15 minutes to receive two items is ridiculous at a fast-food restaurant, especially when the inside of the restaurant was only 40% full on the night I went.\\n\\nThe Food: I ordered a double-double with a side of fries, both were animal style. I had no complaints with the burger; however, the onions on the fries were clearly burnt and tasted gross. If you look at the picture that's attached to this review, you can clearly see a dark/black patch near the top section of the fries; those were the burnt onions. If I had more time, I would've asked for a replacement, but I already had to wait long for my initial order, so I didn't bother.\\n\\nConclusion: While the burgers are decent at this location, the terrible fries and length of time I had to wait to receive my food really annoyed me. I'll stick to the Sunnyvale location for future In-N-Out Burger cravings.\", u\"We have been here a few times for a quick bite on the go. Each time its always packed. Even when they're at their busiest. They still give customers fast service. Unlike other in-n-outs around the bay where you have to wait 15 to 20 min or longer for your food. Not this burger joint. This is definitely my favorite In-N-Out.\\n\\nAmazing service and delicious burgers!\", u\"I don't eat fast food anymore, I gotta start with that.  My GF wanted a double double and animal fries and I'm more than happy to take her.  Restaurant was clean, employees were friendly, service was decent overall.\\nShe was happy with the burger, apprently the fries were only 'ok'.\\nIt's a once or twice a year craving for her so I guess we'll be back in a few months.\", u'I Love this place always friendly staff.,\\nin and out are the best burgers in America, for 7 bucks', u'Huge fan of coming to this burger joint when it\\'s late at night and the tummy is grumbling. You always get service with a smile here, no matter what time you come. The greeter at the drive-through line is pleasant and really helps to expedite the ordering process. So far, they\\'ve never gotten my order wrong, and the \"to go\" packaging is clean and neat. I get everything \"animal style\"- fries and burger. It\\'s nice that they have the healthier protein style version, without the bun. Still tasty, but minus the extra carbs and calories. Good combo. The milkshake is quite sweet, and it fills you up fast. This place is great for those late night cravings.', u\"Okay ... Who doesn't like in and out?!??!??!? We don't have this in Colorado!!!every family member and friend that I have visit me here always wants to go to in and out!! Since this is the closets to my home! I Iove it! and the fact that their open until 1 am!! is even better. The burgers are devine and the animal fries are danm awesome!!!!!\", u'Whether it\\'s the little red palm trees or the tangy special spread, I\\'m not sure. What I do know is I absolutely love In-N-Out Burger. No matter where I go (LA, SD, SF, SB) the \"#2 spread only\" is consistently delicious. Why give this place four stars and not five? Upon getting food from this location tonight I was served exceptionally crispy fries. Were they delicious when doused in special sauce? Yes, but too crispy nonetheless.\\n\\nOn a brighter note, other things I like about every In-N-Out:\\n- Consistenly friendly service\\n- They have never messed up my order\\n- High Quality food\\n- Inexpensive prices\\n- Clean atmosphere\\n- Free stickers :)', u\"I have only done drive through because I feel like that's how it supposed to be done.  I remember when I was in college driving to SoCal to have these infamous burgers and, of course, the bumper stickers.  \\n\\nWith all of the gross stuff we hear about in our fast food, this is solid. Fries are ok ... Burgers are small but great. Driving lines can be long but they work really hard to combat that.  \\n\\nThe bible verses hidden on the plates and cups are weird. Really weird.\\n\\nLove the diaper pins.  If you go there you will see\", u'A few bucks for a gourmet burger and fries? And free lemon slices for my cup of water?\\n\\nYes please.\\n\\nNot a bad burger. Juicy even without added sauce. Next time I\\'ll skip the \"well done\" fries from the secret menu in favor of the normal fries. The well done fries are crispier, but maybe a little too crispy, and lose some of the natural potato flavor in exchange for more calories.\\n\\nPoint is, the wonderful workers here will make it for you the way you ask. All served with a smile. Somebody even came by after and took my trash for me.\\n\\nParking and seating are ample. Restrooms are even kept clean.\\n\\nYou guys are too good to me.', u'Who would give ratings below 5 stars? In n out is legend. Thank you for your wonderful service.', u'We frequently visit this eatery since my kids love in-n-out. The food is great, staff are friendly and the place is clean.', u'I enjoy in-n-out, I really do, but I was extremely disappointed with the service here. Two friends ordered fries (animal style) separately. We waited and noticed that the large group of kids that came in about five to seven minutes after us had received their burgers and fries before us. We continued to wait, hoping that our fres would eventually come out. 57, 59, 63, 66. Nope, nothing. We were number 52 and 53 (again different registers). We asked about our orders. We had hoped it would be some of the next few orders of fries that were coming out. Nope again. Another 10 minutes and we finally get our food. Nearly 30 minutes for two orders of french fries. The disappointment was real.', u\"Talk about a delicious cheat meal. Always consistent in taste and quality. A mouth orgasm if I say so myself. Good service and a clean positive atmosphere.  It's a good thing I don't live around the corner because I'd occupy frequently and become obese!\", u'Have never gave one of my favorite spots to eat a one star review. The food at this place is amazing but unfortunately when I tried to order I was denied service because my order was \"too large\" and she didn\\'t want to deal with it....\\n\\nI came in after the Drake and Lil wayne concert ten minutes before the closed and asked if they were closed. The person at the register told me no and when my friends and I order 12 cheeseburgers the lady who was the manager on duty at the time told the person at the register that they wouldn\\'t take that order and that it was too late and she didn\\'t want to deal with it.....the doors were not even locked yet and the lady manager was beyond rude.\\n\\nThe whole situation was a Damn shame because In n Out has a reputation for having amazing employees and outstanding customer service. I work in the area and my company spends about $300 there a WEEK! Not anymore though it\\'s really sad that I have to settle for other options.  The date I came in was 9/16', u\"I use to love this place until their french fries stopped tasting fresh. Now they are very dry  :(\\nOverall the service is nice and the location is pretty clean. The bathroom are also well maintained. i usually sit down at this location.\\nAnd the food went from 10/10 to 9/10 but it's still pretty good!\", u'Love In and Out Burger- however- this franchise on El Camino Real in Mountain View, CA has the SLOWEST drive thru ever for such a limited menu. Ridiculous.', u\"It's in n out what can I say?  The food was delicious, the fries were fresh, and the order came out pretty fast.\", u'This specific joint was mediocre at best.', u'Alex was so friendly! He made genuine conversation after taking our order. He was great and deserves a raise!', u\"There's something about In-N-Out that makes me crave it whenever I need a late night snack/meal and now that I think about it, it's my go to place for that situation!\\n\\nIn-N-Outs menu is very simple offering a hamburger, cheeseburger, or a double cheeseburger. It's quite cheap too but the quality is very very good and I prefer eating these burgers than restaurant burgers by far. The nice toasted bun and tasty ingredients are to crave for! Despite the misleading limited menu, there's actually a lot of customizations here you can do and my favorite is:\\n\\nCheeseburger\\nWhole grilled onions\\nBurger cut in half\\n\\nWith the fries!\", u\"Slow service , waited almost 10 minutes and that wasn't why I have them two stars.\\nSandwich was Ok , already semi cold when I got it but eatable.

    "FIELD4":"[u'What can I say about a place with 2000+ reviews averaging to 4.5 stars. Clearly this place is a gem. It does get crowded during peak lunch hours but they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and you get helped pretty quickly.\\n\\nThe food was definitely one of the best mediterranean food I have had. My friend and I got the Shish Kebab and Shish Taouk plate. The portions were quite large and our waitress was super nice and friendly. I like the fact that the service was good even during crowded hours. Will definitely come back again.', u'This is my second time visiting Dishdash. Never a disappointment but always full of people.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED SALAD\\nLamb Shawarma salad\\nThe proportion of Matt and green is just perfect. Very juicy lamb but not too overwhelming, thanks to the garlic Greek yogurt sauce. Highly recommended.', u\"Overall: very tasty, reasonably priced, long wait, don't go on a summer Wednesday (unless you like huge drunken crowds and deafening music).\\n\\nFuture self, please get:\\n- Rihan Appetizer: grilled eggplant, tomatoes, almond basil, feta ($8) - the pine nuts added a delicious crunch!\\n- Chicken Shawarma Appetizer: thinly sliced chicken, grilled onions, hummus ($9) - basically a hummus dish with some chicken thrown on top - but hearty and tasty nonetheless\\n- Mansaf Entree: tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt ($19) - sauce was delicious, lamb was so so tender (not a ton of meat on the plate) - yet the sauce is thick enough that it's very filling! Highly recommend!\\n- Shish Taouk Entree: cubes of charbroiled, free-range chicken breast, seasonal vegetables ($18) The chicken was extremely moist and perfectly cooked! Rice and broccoli were filler foods.\\n\\nThis was the perfect amount of food for 4 people (2 apps, 2 entrees).\\n\\nRecommend! Looking forward to returning :)\", u'Back in high school, I remember walking by a classmate in Ms. Bragg\\'s English class as he was regaling people around him with the story of how his entire basketball team managed to pull an IHOP dine-and-dash.  Now, I was a very, very sheltered kid and had to ask him afterward to define \"dine-and-dash.\"  When he did, I think I shot him a withering look (my first job was at a family owned Chinese restaurant, and I definitely wouldn\\'t have appreciated customers walking out without paying the bill).\\n\\nA decade+ later (my how time flies)!, I couldn\\'t help but think about that interaction when my good friend, Jacque C., mentioned that she had made dinner reservations for our mutual friend\\'s surprise birthday party at DishDash.\\n\\nAnother thing about me, I\\'m not very good with surprises - receiving them, planning them, etc.  It just messes with my whole control freak streak.  To make a long story short, after having to ruin the surprise in order to get our hangry friend from beque to DishDash, we arrived half an hour past our reservation.  I called on our drive over and the woman on the phone said that while she had already given up our table, she would try her best to seat us when we arrived.  When we finally arrived, the restaurant was packed (what do you expect on a Saturday night?), and I had to wade through a large group of people standing right inside the front door to get to the hostesses.  The hostess I spoke to was true to her word, and graciously managed to seat us within 10 minutes of getting there - awesome!\\n\\nAt this point, all of us hangry Type A gals had our noses in our menus, fuming a little about being late.  Luckily for us, we had a really attentive waiter who seemed to sense impending danger and swooped in with fresh pita bread and an olive oil based dipping sauce.  Thank you, thank you.  By the time he circled back around to take our order, we had wolfed it all down and a passing busboy came around with another plate.\\n\\nSince my brain had yet to register the wads of pita bread heading down my esophagus, I asked for the maza sampler for 4, confident that we could polish all of that off.  Our waiter smiled and talked me down from the 4-person ledge to the 2, reassuring me that it was plenty.  For a split second my competitive side reared forward and I heard myself say, \"Just because we\\'re tiny Asian girls doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t eat!\"  Oy vey.  As soon as that sentenced actually registered in my brain, I cringed, mumbled my dinner order, and stuck another piece of pita bread in my trap.\\n\\nTen minutes or so later, pita bread sitting pretty in my tummy, the maza sampler arrived and I was so glad the waiter made the recommendation he did.  We BARELY finished everything, and once we did, we regretted ordering an appetizer altogether since our dinner entree servings were equally as generous.  I wanted to cry because I couldn\\'t finish my plateful of deliciously tender and perfectly seasoned tika kebab over fluffy basmati rice.\\n\\nMaybe some of y\\'all know that horrible, horrible feeling of being absolutely STUFFED and still wanting to shovel down food.  Oh well.  I think at that point i knew I would have died and gone to heaven perfectly content.\\n\\nJust thinking about the tika kebab as I type this is making my mouth water.  I can\\'t recommend DishDash enough, and I know it\\'s a place I\\'d confidently take my family and friends to.', u\"The food has been consistently delicious every time I've eaten here for dinner, and you'll find some unique middle eastern dishes expertly cooked and presented with intention. Of course, you'd have to be a fan of this type of food to enjoy it. However, I found the flavors quite palatable with spices that are mild enough not to be too scary or intimidating.\\n\\nThe place is almost always full (even on weekdays), so I'd recommend making reservations. For bigger parties above four, they may not have tables until later in the evening like 8pm if you call on the same day. There's also walk-in room, but expect to wait about an hour or more during prime meal times, even though the seating area is decently large. In the past, I've always had reservations, which I'd highly recommend.\\n\\nI love that they kick off the meal with a complementary basket of warm pita bread and dipping sauce. Be careful not to fill up on the bread though, as the best is yet to come.\\n\\nFor the entree, I ordered the M'tabaq (salmon over a round of eggplant in a tomato-based sauce), which was delicious and unlike anything I'd seen before. It was well-cooked and juicy and the sauce complemented the dish nicely.\\n\\nNote that they only take four credit cards maximum, so plan accordingly if you have a big group.\\n\\nAll in all, truly inspired cuisine that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else and definitely one of the best restaurants in Sunnyvale.\", u\"Oh, I'm loving it! The food is super delicious! My brother and I ordered take-out foods, the food portions was huge--great for sharing! The following food we ordered are:\\n\\nChicken Shawarma: grilled chicken, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, greens, garlic yogurt $9.95\\nEggplant Falafel: falafel, grilled eggplant, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, parsley, tahini $10.95\\nMansaf: tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt $16.95\\nBaklava: Assortment of traditional baklava pastries. Layers of thin filo dough, nuts, and honey. $7.60\\nMango Lassi: Mango yogurt (price unknown, not on the menu)\\n\\nPros:\\n--foods are delish\\n--huge portions for take out\\n\\nCons:\\n--price is pretty pricey\\n--long waiting for pick up foods\\n\\nI want to come back to eat inside the restaurant and try other dishes.\", u'This restaurant stradles that fine line between \"nice dinner restaurant\" and \"work lunch spot.\"    \\n\\nI ordered the combo kabob plate (chicken and steak) and it was good....definitely a step above the kind of fast food lunch spots.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is right in Downtown Sunnyvale and there are plenty of outside seating.   The prices are a bit on the high side for what you get and I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to eat here but if you are in Downtown Sunnyvale it\\'s definitely a solid option', u\"Had a great dinner with a large group of friends last night. They take reservations and can accomodate larger groups in a back room seating area.\\n\\nI love the pita bread and dip they bring for the table. I ended up ordering the mezzeh for 2 appetizer as my entree. It was good, but I think slightly overpriced for what it is. My boyfriend ordered the zahra lamb shank, and it was delicious! After tax / tip, he paid about $30 just for that dish, but it was worth every bite. It's huge though, so come hungry or share with someone!\", u'A nice place for an evening dinner date. For no special reason, my husband wanted to have a \"date night.\" We read the wonderful reviews on their Mansaf(tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt) and Beriani (tender cubes of beef, potatoes, raisins, garbanzo beans, aged yogurt)..so that is what we had. We loved it!\\nWe ordered the Maza Sampler, however, it came after our main entr\\xe9e. Our server was very apologetic and even provided it gratis. It made a difference because considering it was our first time there, we definitely didn\\'t want to have a poor impression of the place considering many people on Yelp have said that service has deteriorated. We hope to return soon and bring along some friends.', u\"4.5 stars with over a thousand reviews is reserved only for legends (like Phil's BBQ and Sushi Gen) and good ice cream places (who can say no to sugar, cream, creative flavors, long lines, and blissful ice cream food porn).\\n\\nDespite being spoiled by the culinary mecca of SF, ever since I found out about the legendary DishDash I've been on my marks, get set, DASH. With extensive menu full of exotic-sounding dishes, I looked forward to finally venturing beyond my typical shawarma-falafel-kebab cycle.\\n\\nShish Taouk ($15) cubes of charbroiled, free-range chicken, seasonal vegetables || I sometimes consider myself quasi-vegetarian, but that thought goes down in flames whenever I encounter something like DishDash kebabs (or pork belly, my greatest weakness). The juicy/tenderness is balanced with a just-right slightly charred surface at yakitori perfection. With the rich chicken taste, I wouldn't doubt their brag about free-range. They take care in grilling veggies too so it's not a burnt soggy mess of onions and bell peppers like most places; however it would have been ice to have more than 3 pieces of broccoli.\\n\\nSabanech ($16) slow-cooked lamb w/ spinach, black-eyed beans, onions || It's slow-cooked to melt-in-your-mouth lamb. I expected a flavor explosion of pungent spices, but it turned out to be a rather simple cooking style. Basic lamb stew. (Basic in a good sense)\\n\\nBeriani Dajaj ($15)  thinly sliced chicken breast, potatoes, raisins, garbanzo beans, aged yogurt || Yes! I love yogurt because it is guilt-free cream sauce. That being said, mixing the chicken and yogurt sauce into the rice makes a hearty and memorable meal. The golden raisins add an interesting contrast--one of those additions that you are initially hesitant about, but turns out to be overall delicious and makes you speculate if it's one of those spins that food critics praise in their sophisticated reviews. The shis taouk is to die for, but the beriani dajaj is perhaps my favorite dish because it was so unique.\\n\\nEntrees come with a choice of carbs. The basmati rice is richly flavored with tumeric and other spices, as evidenced with the bright yellow hue. The freekeh (apparently seasonal per the menu) may sound funny but it was tasty--somewhat like a brown rice whole grain quinoa.\\n\\nAll the food was absolutely delicious and inhaled with very minimal conversation.\\n\\nWith my totes fan girl review, you are probably wondering why 4 stars. I hate to be negative and knock off stars based on service, but our server was terribly condescending. I don't know if she was annoyed that we didn't order appetizers (entree portions were huge though... sheeeesh kebabs), that we just had waters, or if she was upset that I was mispronouncing names of dishes while ordering. She didn't bring or even offer the complimentary pita bread and dip (Yelpers tell me I'm not missing out, but the aesthetic pita in the wooden bowl would have given me better food pics). Ohs wells. Maybe the servers at the Milpitas location will be less angsty when we come here for lunch and only order $15 entrees.... after all, it's MilPITAs :3\", u'First, let me say the food and service are great, and if I have to be out in the \\'burbs, DishDash is great and has a ton of vegetarian options.\\n\\nBut two things bugged me on our recent visit: 1) The menu now has \"18% gratuity appreciated\" printed on it, which was very presumptuous and put me off -- I normally tip 20-25%, but it\\'s the attitude that I found obnoxious. 2) We were seated in the bar area, which has THREE huge TVs with sports playing -- on a Saturday night! It really ruined the atmosphere. However, the restaurant has 4 large rooms, plus outdoor seating, so I would just request a table away from the TVs, especially if you\\'re planning to enjoy a romantic dinner.\\n\\nGetting that out of the way, I\\'ve been here several times and the service has always been friendly and impeccable. Even if you eat a lot of Mediterranean food (I do!), DishDash has flavors that are inventive and unusual, with authentic ingredients that aren\\'t often found at other places (freekeh, for instance). Even the \"traditional\" items like babaganuj and tabbouleh are of higher quality than one typically finds at Mediterranean restaurants. I\\'ve never had a bad dish here.  \\n\\nThere is a whole section of vegetarian entrees, and most of the appetizers are veg as well. Get the meza platter so that you can sample all of the apps. Even the salads are top-notch. Just come try it, especially on a warm day so you can sit outside.', u\"Oh my goodness, still having flashbacks about how delicious this place was.\\n\\nIf you are anything like me and love Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, DishDash is the place for you. With a large menu, friendly service, and lovely atmosphere, it will please even the pickiest eater.\\n\\nWe started out with the complimentary warm pita bread with dip and some Cab, ($14 a glass) and didn't feel rushed at all which was perfect. While everything looked good, I opted to order the Zahra, which was braised lamb shank with cauliflower in an aged yogurt sauce served with your choice of either rice or freekeh. Wanting to try something new I ordered the freekeh (best described as buckwheat, and was a bit bland for my tastebuds) and realized a couple bites later I should have went for the rice, but it wasn't a huge deal.\\n\\nThe dish itself was exquisite. The lamb was so tender, flavorful, and rich, exactly the way lamb shank should taste. No gaminess, and just the right balance of spices. The cauliflower made for a wonderful accompaniment, the creamy yogurt sauce was seasoned perfectly. The people at my table who had a bite off my plate tried to come back for more so I had to fend them off lol!  \\n\\nWe did go for dessert and ordered Arabic coffee and Kenafeh (which btw takes about 15 to prepare to if you're short on time could be something to consider!) My friends both obsessed over the Kenafeh but honestly I thought it was pretty dry and uninteresting and would probably go with a different desert next time but that is just me! The coffee on the other hand was delicious.\\n\\nOverall I was a happy camper. This place is not cheap but makes up for it in quality. There is something here for everyone :)\", u'Pretty cool ambience (esp around the long table facing the bar). They have good appetizers like most other Mediterranean place but what makes the difference is their entree. They have such big portions of entrees that you will be stuffed. They also have no meat-no eggs entree which is delicious as well.', u\"Food here is pretty good. Service is not good when it is busy.\\n\\nWe had beriani dejaj and lamb bamei. The beriani dejaj is so creamy and good. I wish I had that instead of the lamb bamei I got. Its only because I don't like lamb.\", u\"We found this place on Yelp due to the high reviews. Over 2000 reviews and 4.5 stars is very credible and seemed like a no brainer for us on our first night up in the Bay Area.  We had the gambari and falafels for appetizer which I both recommend. For dinner we had the sambusak, which was really tasty. I love the Mediterranean flavored as they are unique compared to other cuisines. The restaurant seemed like easily the best option on a cool Murphy street. They were packed as expected so be prepared to wait or come at a less busy time. The servers did a great job at fitting is in quickly and even moved us from a two to four person table when my cousin decided to come. I wish we had a restaurant like this in the San Diego area. The high reviews don't lie and you shouldn't be let down.\", u'6/11/15: Came here for lunch today and was impressed!  It was a little confusing cause there\\'s a popular chain called \"Dish n Dash\" which apparently is not the same thing.  But, after looking them up, I guess it\\'s all owned by the same folks, and the \"n\" version is kinda their fast-foodish offshoot.  I\\'ve been to Dish n Dash too, and it tastes good, but prices were almost offensively high.  Here prices are still a little expensive but the food is fancier and it\\'s a nice restaurant so I think it\\'s more justified.\\n\\n1. Pineapple-coconut juice $3.5: Very nice drink.  Syrupy with good coconut flavor.  I\\'m not the hugest fan of coconut, but it\\'s very well balanced in this drink.  Kinda wish I could taste more pineapple, but I dunno, maybe it wouldn\\'t be as good.  Decent price for the quality.  7/10.\\n\\n2. Mansaf $16.95: The dish they serve it on is large and the pile of rice and stewed lamb is served on a bed of creamy yellow sauce that fills the entire plate.  I would say the rice and lamb fills about a medium-sized bowl.  Love the sauce--can\\'t really place the dominant flavor, but it\\'s really rich and yummy.  Rice is good.  The lamb is very tender and has a good amount of fat, making it taste pretty good.  Might be a tad expensive for what you get, but heck, it tastes really good.  9/10.\\n\\nI\\'d love to come back.  Never had anything like that mansaf before.  I dunno if I just never went to any good middle eastern places, but so far this place is the best I\\'ve tried based on my limited selection of stuff.\\n\\nOne thing to note: our service was horrible.  After serving us the food outside I couldn\\'t find a server anymore to ask for water.  People were nice enough, but it\\'s just that there were no waiters to be found.\\n\\nFor now... 5/5.\\n\\n#middleeastern #mediterranean', u\"Vegetarians and omnivores alike will delight in this restaurant.  We had a vegetarian among our party of four last night at DishDash and he really enjoyed having so many dishes to choose from for dinner!\\n\\nWe started with the Maza Platter for 4. I often find baba ganoush and hummus pretty bland in most Middle Eastern restaurants, but the hummus and baba ganoush here were very tasty. Seasoning was perfect and they were wonderful slathered on pita bread.  I especially liked the Rihan app. It has grilled eggplant, tomatoes, basil and fresh feta. So delicious. If you're an eggplant lover like me, you will love this app.  I didn't eat as much of the pita bread as my husband as I wanted to have room and enjoy my main entree!\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered the same thing--the Mansaf. I ordered a Kebab dish the first time we ate here a few years ago. I'm so glad I ordered the Mansaf this time. Delicious!!!! I loved how flavorful the dish was. The lamb was tender, the rice and yogurt sauce were tasty and loved the crunch from the slivered almonds. The hubby ordered and loved Lamb Shank dish with tomatoes and onions. I tasted his lamb and it was very good too. I think my dish was better though. :). My friend's husband ordered the falafel dish with tomatoes and onions, and it must have been good 'cause he wiped it clean.\\n\\nWe did not have dessert unfortunately. We had no room in our tummies. For beverages, I had the lemonade with mint. It was a little too sweet for me, so I added some water to tone down the sweetness. My friend had a pineapple juice mix and she really like it too.\\n\\nWe'll have to come back here. The food was fabulous. Service was great and the ambience was nice. This is an extremely popular restaurant, so make a reservation! They had heat lamps outside so you can eat alfresco even at night. They also accommodate big groups.\", u'Oh Dish Dash, I finally got to try you and you let me down in multiple ways\\n\\n4 of us went to Dish Dash we had reservations thank God, I heard this place was smallish and always busy and in fact to busy. The host took us to a table inside and disappeared. We looked over our menu\\'s and he came back asking about drinks, so ice tea and water appeared on our table and a small basket of Peta bread and a dipping plate. The bread was gone in about 2 mins... Yes we have 4 people at the table not 2, bring us a bigger thing of bread !! So as we wait for someone to take our order, and then wait, and then wait even more the waiter comes by and we asked 3 different people for more bread !!  Only the bus boy came through for us... Now we order some Hummus and dinner and wait.\\n\\nThe Hummus appears, but no bread, we are out, please bring us more bread !! 5 mins later more bread appears and we have to ask, can we get more water and so on you get the idea, so I will cut this short, the thing that pissed me off the most was at the end of the dinner, when they pick up your plates pretty fast, I am guessing to get you out the door to get the next round of people in, a lady comes to our table and asks us would you like to see the desert menu?  I look and her and say \" Yes Please, it\\'s her B Day \" and she smiles at me only to never be seen again ( WTH ) and no menu, 5 to 10 mins later our waiter comes by and asks if we want to see the desert menu.. OMG Epic Fail..... Bad Bad Bad Dish Dash...\\n\\nPRO:\\nFood is good and lots of choices\\n\\nCON:\\nWay to busy..\\nWay to over booked..\\nBread basket is the same for single or 4 / 6 people\\nStaff is way to over worked or just fails at remembering what you asked for...\\nWait for almost everything just ended up making us ask, was it really worth coming to a place like this, since we were ready to bail out the door a few times and just hit Kabuls a few blocks down!!\\nTends to rune birthday moments ( thank you so much for that ) !!! So please don\\'t bring anyone here for special event', u\"JIZZ IN YOUR PANTS GOOD. No kidding.\\n\\nOrder the Mansaf!\\n\\nI had a special moment with one of the lamb dishes that I haven't encountered before at this restaurant. It seems like everyone in the South bay and their mom have been here at least once, since its known as one of the finest restaurants to visit in the Sunnyvale area.\\n\\nRESERVATION SITUATION\\nDecided to have dinner here after 8:30 pm (they close at 9:30) on a Thursday, without reservations, with my mom. When we arrived, the place was swarming with patrons. In spite of the seemingly packed venue, my mom and I were seated at a table in approx. 15 minutes. We were fortunate at that moment, but I highly recommend that you make reservations at least a day or two in advance, as this restaurant has become increasingly popular over the years.\\n\\nFEELING ADVENTUROUS\\nIn the past, I had always resorted to ordering their savory kabob dishes, but when I visited for dinner during this particular evening, I was feeling some of that 'Yelper boldness', so I decided to ask our server for his entr\\xe9e recommendation. With no hesitation, he eagerly advised me to order the Mansaf and I went for it. All entrees come with your choice of Freekeh, or basmati rice topped with sliced, toasted almonds.\\n\\nENTREES & DESSERT\\n+ MANSAF $18.95: Mmm, my palate felt pampered by the silky melody of exceptionally delicate lamb, slow-cooked in aged yogurt, with almond-topped basmati rice. Friggen brilliant. Rice was perfectly cooked and the yogurt was super flavorful. My only gripe was that the small chunks of lamb were extremely tender, rapidly melting in my mouth, so the meat's flavor quickly got lost in the rich, abundant yogurt sauce. I only wish that the lamb flavor was a little more outstanding, or perhaps I wish the chunks of lamb were larger. Don't fret---there really IS lamb in the dish. The small chunks of lamb are HIDDEN inside the dome of basmati rice! 0.o More lamb flavor though, please Dish Dash. :/\\n\\n+ MASHWI $24.95: SHIEET, I didn't have the chance to mooch off my mom's dish, because she immediately scarfed it down, so she was obviously impressed by her order (Marinated, grilled sea bass, prawns, and seasonal vegetables).\\n\\nWe ended the night with the 'Cho-kolata' lava cake with ice cream $8.00, which we don't particularly recommend. I'm a total dessert fiend, but the elementary ingredients were anything but unique. I could've purchased a cheap tub of ice cream and pre-packaged lava cake from Safeway and my rendition of this Cho-kolata dessert would be just as mediocre.\\n\\nDRINK RECOMMENDATIONS\\nTheir drink menu, especially their wine list, is pretty extensive. Per our server's recommendation, I ordered the Zanzabeel (ginger, apple juice, mint, ginger beer, Michter's Sour Mash Whiskey). All cocktails are $10.00. If you enjoy ginger and mint, then you'll appreciate this drink. My mom ordered the Terre Rouge Syrah $11.00. We thoroughly savored our drinks. They also serve draft and bottled beer and single malt scotch.\\n\\nVENUE\\nI really, really dig the bustling locale. A 'Cocktail Happy Hour,' chill kind of crowd. It's kinda loud inside, so you may have to shout at your dinner companion. I'm considering adding this restaurant to my 'Make the Panties Drop' list. Although the venue isn't exactly romantic, you could still possibly make her panties drop with the acclaimed 'authenticity' of the dishes here and the wonderful ambiance. Saw some dude at the table next to us caressing a woman's arm and it looked like she was pretty amused. Get it in, bro.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nFriendly service is satisfactory (15% solid tip), but not worth the 18% tip that the restaurant recommends/appreciates. Call me cheap or finicky, but I wasn't charmed.\\n\\nVERDICT\\nOverall, a solid four-star restaurant. I deducted one star merely because the flavors of the dishes here don't surpass the flavors I've encountered with dishes that cost less at other restaurants I've been to. Nevertheless, delicious food. In my opinion, you're essentially paying more $$ here for their 'fresher' ingredients, delightful ambiance, and neater presentation.\\n\\n+ Vegetarian options\\n+ Catering is available\\n+ Street parking and Macy's parking lot\", u'Excellent everything! Perfect service. Delicious food. First time here and I love it. Attentive waiter. Helped us figure out the menu. Good quality food. A bit pricy but worth it. Love the d\\xe9cor.', u\"Probably the best resto in Sunnyvale if not the South Bay. I've tried everything but the lamb (ugh). The fattoush salad is easily shared by 4 people.  The beef and chicken kebabs w/veggies are delicious as is the  Mashwi (grilled seabass & prawns w/veggies.  A bit different is the Shakshuka (prawns in an eggplant and tomato sauce).  Unless you want to wait for hours (or be turned away) make reservations.  Consistently good food and service.\", u\"Honestly, i could even say 4.5. I have been to many Persian restaurants before, and was expecting a nice koobideh, but was very surprised when I opened the menu and saw lots of unknown dishes. I asked the waiter and he recommended the Mansaf - slow cooked lamb over basmati rice covered with aged yogurt - and it was delicious! This dish was incredible - full of spices and flavor, and incredibly unique. I also tried my friends tabsi (another dish i've never tried before) and another uniquely spiced dish. The service here was also very great. I asked for 1/2 rice 1/2 freekah (quinoa type), but he recommended the rice and gave me a small side of freekah to try for free, which I found to be incredibly nice. We also got the kunafah, but I found it to be less sweet than I have had in other places. I will be back here for sure.\", u\"Being Palestinian, it's pretty hard to impress us when eating middle eastern foods. But honestly, everything we ate was on point. You can taste the quality of the food. Very tasty!!!! Oh downfall was the timing between appetizers and main meals. It took a while.\", u\"Best place in the South Bay! Excellent service and great ambience. I love the lamb dishes, especially the Lamb Masaf and the Shih Tahouk.\\nUsually, I start with a vodka martini and continue with a nice Malbec. Don't miss the chocolate lava cake. It's prepared fresh, so it's recommended to order it 15-30 minutes in advance.\", u'Went here last week and the food was great. We had to wait 20-25 mins to get seated.\\n\\nThey used modern tech to alert us via text messages when the seats were available, which was cool. Our server was attentive enough. It was understandable because the restaurant was full at the time. We had to wait quite a long time for a check at the end. The guys who gave food and cleaned up our table were very polite and seemed to be more attentive than our own server, who returned the wrong check afterwards lol. Anyway, understandable.\\n\\nAbout the food, dry but tasty. I had Teka Kebab which was ordered as medium well. They came out perfectly. The beef was great, reasonably seasoned. I like how they made the vege. Nice dressing with broccoli. Coming with the dish was a green and sour sauce. Oh, speaking of sauce, the one they gave us at the start with the bread... it tasted so weird... oily and bland.. but I believed that was made from some kind of ethnic herbs.... anyway, it was strange. maybe it was supposed to taste like that. Not a big fan, but glad that I tried.\\n\\nIn terms of pricing, it was good. I came out full and satisfied so that was good.', u\"I love Mediterranean food, but unfortunately that often means just hummus and falafel- this restaurant offers a wider range of meal options- which are super tasty! They serve bread first with a strange sesame seed dipping sauce, which I thought tasted kind of weird. I ordered the M'shakaleh, which was sooo good and unlike anything I've ever tasted. My friend got the shakshuka, which was different than other shakshuka's I've had, and was just ok. I really like the environment of this restaurant as well- I will be back!\", u'DISHDASH IS HOME TO THE BEST FALAFELS YOU WILL EVER HAVE.\\n\\nFreshly baked, out of the oven. Or are they fried? Whatever.\\nAwesome. (This is my favorite adjective to describe things I like.)\\nLovely. You will fall in love.\\nAngelic. If you go to heaven, you\\'ll be able to eat these forever.\\nFluffy!\\nEdible. Very, very edible.\\nLegitimate. You might think, \"Holy !@#$, I can\\'t believe it\\'s not falafels!\"\\n\\n...but oh yes, it is falafels.\\n\\nP.S. Everything else is good, too!', u\"Oh DishDash. You're my go to for beriani.\\n\\nFOOD - I always get the beriani dajaj (chicken, potatoes, almond slivers, raisins, beans, and aged-yogurt with rice) and it never does me wrong. As for the Sabanech (lamb shank, spinach, beans)... I enjoyed the lamb but was not a fan of the spinach and bean mixture. A bit too drenched.\\n\\nAMBIANCE - It's a nice atmosphere with dimmed lighting. Crowded often, even on random Wednesday nights. However, I don't enjoy how close the tables in the middle are together. You can hear the conversations of the people next to you if you're quiet.\\n\\nOTHER - I love that they text you when your table is ready so you can walk around without a big buzzer, there is complimentary warm pita bread and the great service.\", u\"It's always nice to get out of your comfort zone and try something out of the ordinary. Thank you to my girLs for accompanying me to this spot!!\\n\\nLong Lines outside is a great indication that there's something magical going on inside. This is a tiny location that gets pretty packed quickly so come prepared for a possibLe wait.\\nDishDash offers a vast menu and is guaranteed to satisfy even your pickiest eaters.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\nMaza SampLer for 4\\nBeriani- Beef with aged yogurt sauce\\nMashwi- Seabass + Prawns\\nM'Sakhan- Chicken wrapped in crust w/saffron yogurt\\nCho-KoLata- Choc Lava Cake\\nKenafeh- FiLodough + Cheese dessert\\n\\nFirst off, the complimentary pita and dip is amazeballs. I had to force myself to stop eating it in order to make room for all the food we ordered.\\nMasa Mediterranean SampLer is a must. A smorgasbord of delicious dips to get your tastebuds warmed up.\\nBeriani had chunks of beef cooked with potatoes, almonds, & raisins cooked in a yogurt sauce. Normally I'm not a fan of cooked raisins but I define made an acception with this. Creamy sauce that was not overbearing.\\nPresentation for the M'Sakhan is a jaw dropper. It's like a delicious edible present that you just can't wait to open. Crispy on the outside and moist cooked chicken on the inside.\\nCho-KoLata is your typical Lava cake- Nothing too thrilling. Kenafeh on the other hand is out of this world!! BeautifuL and deLicious with its crispy exterior and cheesy interior that isn't overwhelmingLy sweet.\\n\\nI will most definitely be back to try a few other dishes. Keep up the great work DishDash :)\", u\"I'm always baffled by the crowds at Dish Dash. I have tried going there five times. Each time, the food has not been good; the service has been marginal three of those five times. One time, the food was so salty as to be inedible. Another time, a hot dish arrived at room temperature. At every visit, I've ordered classic dishes that I've had elsewhere. And always DishDash's preparation has been inferior. I have always gone to this restaurant with other people and they've almost always been disappointed in their dinners.\\n\\nPerhaps the large portion sizes are the draw at DishDash? There are so many restaurants on Murphy Street, including a competitor across the street where the food is far better and the service is appropriately attentive.\", u'If you love lamb as I do, the Sabanech is a must have. Slow cooked lamb, spinach, black-eyed beans, onions.  Subtle yet sublime.', u'Let\\'s talk about the best beriani I\\'ve ever had. OK, I rarely eat beriani and I\\'m still confused about whether \"beriani\" is just an alternative name for what we all know as biryani. It doesn\\'t matter because I\\'m not a regular consumer of either. Anyway, DishDash\\'s Beriani Dajaj is simply phenomenal. Actually, all of their dishes are well executed with generous portions and fragrant flavors.\\n\\nWhile the rest of Murphy Street is quiet and ho-hum, you will find bustling crowds waiting outside of DishDash. Make a reservation if you can. If you\\'re not able to, try to swing by during non-primetime hours.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 on a Saturday night but we actually showed up an hour beforehand. Since we didn\\'t hit the dinner rush yet, the hostess was able to accommodate our early arrival. (You can say that we were just REALLY excited to try DishDash...or just terrible with time management.)\\n\\nThe venue is deceptively big and unexpectedly romantic/intimate. We were led to our table in a room near the back. A server plopped down a basket of pita bread and some type of dipping sauce. DON\\'T make the same silly mistake as I did and fill up on the pita bread--as tempting as it is (and they offer free refills).\\n\\nI\\'m a huge fan of Chimay and was pleasantly surprised to find that DishDash carries this beer. First thing we ordered! Priorities.\\n\\nAfter taking some sips, we opted for the following:  \\n\\n*Falafels - crispy blend of organic garbanzo beans with tahini sauce. One of my friends recommended DishDash solely based on their amazing falafels, and they ARE amazing. A crunchy exterior with a moist and grainy center, it can proudly stand as a one-man show on its own, or a harmonious duo with the tahini sauce as well.\\n\\n*Kufta Kebab with Freekah - minced beef and lamb with blended herbs and seasonal vegetables (Brussels sprouts, carrots, tomatoes, onions). Essentially beef and lamb sausages...but to the next level of deliciousness! The dish comes with a zesty green sauce, perfect for dipping the kebabs. The entrees are paired with either Basmati Rice or Freekah; the latter piqued our interest. It\\'s similar to couscous and a lovely base for the kebab.\\n\\n*Beriani Dajaj - thinly sliced chicken breast, potatoes, raisins, and garbanzo beans, served with Basmati rice (or Freekah). The ingredients sit in a massive plate of aged yogurt. Oh man. This yogurt. It is rich, creamy, and so addicting. The raisins add a splendidly sweet twist. You must order this! Fantastic. Like I said, it\\'s the best beriani I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nThe service is prompt, attentive, and friendly. The meals might be a bit spendy but definitely worth it for the quality of food. DishDash is my new South Bay favorite!', u\"I've been here several times and have been soo impressed every time. If you're craving some yummy ethnic food, look no further! DishDash has got you covered ;)\\n\\nI've ordered their sausages, kabobs, and seabass/prawn dishes. Service is quick and everything I've ordered has been delicious.\\n\\nOnly problem I had was last time I went, they gave us a dessert menu but left us stranded for half an hour while we waited for them to take our order. By then we decided to grab the check instead of wait longer.\", u\"I just love this place . Party in my mouth.  I am so lucky to be living close, walking distance to it . Unfortunately it's so crowded all the time and I am not very patient  , not 45 minutes to wait for food . The times I went, I was there right at 5pm to be seated ASAP and right when they open for lunch too .\\nMaybe it's better , it gives me more time for my food to digest before the end of the day.\", u\"DishDash is absolutely delicious and amazing!\\n\\nWe came here on a busy Saturday morning, sat by the street-side and peopled gazed as the weekly farmer's market was going on.(Such a fun way to take it all in and enjoy a sunny Saturday)!\\n\\nAnyway, ambiance aside, we dived into the menu! We started with a humus platter (it was so flavorful and not salty) topped with pickled veggies. Then we ordered the chicken shawarma wrap, Beriani Dajaj (chicken breast cooked in yogurt based sauce) served with rice, and M'shakaleh Vegetarian (beautifully layered vegetables served in yogurt based sauce) over rice. Oh they were all excellent! The yogurt based sauce has great acidity (#topchefreference) but not overwhelming. The portion was generous and just right for three people.\\n\\nIt's been two days since our fabulous lunch at DishDash, and I already wanna go back! Can't wait for the next time!\", u\"I hadn't tried many Mediterranean dishes before trying Dish Dash, and I am very impressed! Since I don't like lamb, I got the Beef Kebab and it was AMAZING. The beef is cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce and fluffy rice make this dish ON POINT. I don't normally like the vegetables that they had but it wasn't bad with the sauce.\\nAlso, my sister got the chicken kebab and it was also cooked perfectly. The chicken was juicy and not dry at all.\\nThe price of the dishes are a little expensive but it will fill you up!  \\n\\nDefinitely give this place a try :)\", u\"My girlfriend was in town visiting and her favorite cuisine happens to be Mediterranean food. After a Yelp search for Mediterranean food sorted by ratings and also some of word of mouth cross-referencing with trusted friends, DishDash was the chosen restaurant for our date on Saturday night. I called ahead to make a reservation because from what I've seen, the place is usually packed.\\n\\nOn the day of, we were running late and I called again 2 hours before our reservation to push it back and the staff was more than accommodating. We ordered a glass of Park Station Pinot Noir and munched on some of the pita bread while deciding what to order. Based on the waiter's recommendation, we went with the beriani dejaj and shish taouk (chicken kebab). I was extremely impressed with the food and the quality of the chicken. The chicken kebab was cooked absolutely perfectly - tender and white on the inside and still blackened and crisp on the outside. It had a great zesty flavor to it which made eating it with the basmati rice and steamed broccoli a satisfying experience. The beriani also had succulent chicken but I really enjoyed the aged yogurt of this dish. It was unique and I am really glad I ordered it because I wasn't too sure what to expect. The topping of raisins/almonds gave the dish a nice crunch as well. The portions are huge so this was more than enough food for us. I took the leftovers home and had it for lunch the next day and it was still just as delicious. I'll be back here again for sure.\", u\"I'm apparently late to the DishDash party.\\n\\nMost of my South Bay friends on yelp had been to DishDash and what a great thing that is! ;-)  I don't even need to do extensive research. (that's a lie, I studied the menu the night before!)\\n\\nThe place feels a bit claustrophobic with the weird set-up: an awkward hostess stand right in front of the entrance, a smallish/narrow dining section right behind the wall and then to the right, it opens to a larger dining room which also houses the bar area.\\nDefinitely make a reservation because even on a Tuesday night, this place was packed.\\n\\nI had the Bamieh which is slow-cooked lamb with grilled okra, tomatoes, onions and garlic. I love the combination of these flavors as they constitute a more hearty, comforting base for the fall-off-the-bone lamb!  I accompanied this with pickled veggies just to cut through the acidity of the dish.  My friends' entrees also tasted good: the Mashwi with the large prawns and the Mo, king of Kebab with tender beef cubes.\\n\\nDowntown Sunnyvale may only be 2 blocks long, but this restaurant scores big in my book. I'm excited for a return visit.\", u'I had the Bamieh, a slow-cooked lamb dish with okra, tomato sauce and onions, very tender and delicious. I savored and finished the soupy sauce before even venturing into the nice size lamb shank on well presented plate. The rice was yummy and perfect with this dish.\\n\\nThis was our second visit to DishDash and we were not disappointed. The ambiance was nice and relaxing, not overly loud or crowded and nice energy. The service was very efficient. We ordered our food fairly quickly and started out with a healthy stack of Pita bread to complement our appetizer, the Maza platter which was really flavorful! I like the  olives and hummus on my pita. Even our vegetarian friend  was happy with the selection of vegetarian food options here.\\n\\nMy wife had the Mansaf, which looked wonderful with the pyramid shape of rice surrounded by the soupy mote of yogurt to cool things down. Next time I will order the Mansaf since I did get to tast it and it was fabulous! We were not rushed and the servers were attentive but not overly so which was perfect. I like the lighting and feel of the place which was cozy and warm.\\n\\nThey have tables outside with heat lamps so next dinner here, we will sit outside and enjoy the night with Mediterranean food at DishDash in Sunnyvale. The prices were fair I thought for the quality of food and experience, overall.', u'Hit this place up for lunch on a Friday and it was super busy. Normally, I dislike crowded places, but it was easy to see the service was top-notch, not-stop hustling to get orders out so we took a chance. It also helped that we opted to sit at the bar to cut down on the wait and got our food within 15-20 minutes.\\n\\nI ordered the beriani with beef (more unique, but pricier, ~$16) based on Yelp reviews and my date got the lamb shwarma with a side of fries (cheaper and good value, ~$12, definitely very hearty). Everything was on point: well-seasoned, large portions, but what really stands out is the meat! Extremely moist and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you like meat tender and juicy, this is a prime spot for grubbing!', u'What can I say about a place with 2000+ reviews averaging to 4.5 stars. Clearly this place is a gem. It does get crowded during peak lunch hours but they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and you get helped pretty quickly.\\n\\nThe food was definitely one of the best mediterranean food I have had. My friend and I got the Shish Kebab and Shish Taouk plate. The portions were quite large and our waitress was super nice and friendly. I like the fact that the service was good even during crowded hours. Will definitely come back again.', u'This is my second time visiting Dishdash. Never a disappointment but always full of people.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED SALAD\\nLamb Shawarma salad\\nThe proportion of Matt and green is just perfect. Very juicy lamb but not too overwhelming, thanks to the garlic Greek yogurt sauce. Highly recommended.', u\"Overall: very tasty, reasonably priced, long wait, don't go on a summer Wednesday (unless you like huge drunken crowds and deafening music).\\n\\nFuture self, please get:\\n- Rihan Appetizer: grilled eggplant, tomatoes, almond basil, feta ($8) - the pine nuts added a delicious crunch!\\n- Chicken Shawarma Appetizer: thinly sliced chicken, grilled onions, hummus ($9) - basically a hummus dish with some chicken thrown on top - but hearty and tasty nonetheless\\n- Mansaf Entree: tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt ($19) - sauce was delicious, lamb was so so tender (not a ton of meat on the plate) - yet the sauce is thick enough that it's very filling! Highly recommend!\\n- Shish Taouk Entree: cubes of charbroiled, free-range chicken breast, seasonal vegetables ($18) The chicken was extremely moist and perfectly cooked! Rice and broccoli were filler foods.\\n\\nThis was the perfect amount of food for 4 people (2 apps, 2 entrees).\\n\\nRecommend! Looking forward to returning :)\", u'Back in high school, I remember walking by a classmate in Ms. Bragg\\'s English class as he was regaling people around him with the story of how his entire basketball team managed to pull an IHOP dine-and-dash.  Now, I was a very, very sheltered kid and had to ask him afterward to define \"dine-and-dash.\"  When he did, I think I shot him a withering look (my first job was at a family owned Chinese restaurant, and I definitely wouldn\\'t have appreciated customers walking out without paying the bill).\\n\\nA decade+ later (my how time flies)!, I couldn\\'t help but think about that interaction when my good friend, Jacque C., mentioned that she had made dinner reservations for our mutual friend\\'s surprise birthday party at DishDash.\\n\\nAnother thing about me, I\\'m not very good with surprises - receiving them, planning them, etc.  It just messes with my whole control freak streak.  To make a long story short, after having to ruin the surprise in order to get our hangry friend from beque to DishDash, we arrived half an hour past our reservation.  I called on our drive over and the woman on the phone said that while she had already given up our table, she would try her best to seat us when we arrived.  When we finally arrived, the restaurant was packed (what do you expect on a Saturday night?), and I had to wade through a large group of people standing right inside the front door to get to the hostesses.  The hostess I spoke to was true to her word, and graciously managed to seat us within 10 minutes of getting there - awesome!\\n\\nAt this point, all of us hangry Type A gals had our noses in our menus, fuming a little about being late.  Luckily for us, we had a really attentive waiter who seemed to sense impending danger and swooped in with fresh pita bread and an olive oil based dipping sauce.  Thank you, thank you.  By the time he circled back around to take our order, we had wolfed it all down and a passing busboy came around with another plate.\\n\\nSince my brain had yet to register the wads of pita bread heading down my esophagus, I asked for the maza sampler for 4, confident that we could polish all of that off.  Our waiter smiled and talked me down from the 4-person ledge to the 2, reassuring me that it was plenty.  For a split second my competitive side reared forward and I heard myself say, \"Just because we\\'re tiny Asian girls doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t eat!\"  Oy vey.  As soon as that sentenced actually registered in my brain, I cringed, mumbled my dinner order, and stuck another piece of pita bread in my trap.\\n\\nTen minutes or so later, pita bread sitting pretty in my tummy, the maza sampler arrived and I was so glad the waiter made the recommendation he did.  We BARELY finished everything, and once we did, we regretted ordering an appetizer altogether since our dinner entree servings were equally as generous.  I wanted to cry because I couldn\\'t finish my plateful of deliciously tender and perfectly seasoned tika kebab over fluffy basmati rice.\\n\\nMaybe some of y\\'all know that horrible, horrible feeling of being absolutely STUFFED and still wanting to shovel down food.  Oh well.  I think at that point i knew I would have died and gone to heaven perfectly content.\\n\\nJust thinking about the tika kebab as I type this is making my mouth water.  I can\\'t recommend DishDash enough, and I know it\\'s a place I\\'d confidently take my family and friends to.', u\"The food has been consistently delicious every time I've eaten here for dinner, and you'll find some unique middle eastern dishes expertly cooked and presented with intention. Of course, you'd have to be a fan of this type of food to enjoy it. However, I found the flavors quite palatable with spices that are mild enough not to be too scary or intimidating.\\n\\nThe place is almost always full (even on weekdays), so I'd recommend making reservations. For bigger parties above four, they may not have tables until later in the evening like 8pm if you call on the same day. There's also walk-in room, but expect to wait about an hour or more during prime meal times, even though the seating area is decently large. In the past, I've always had reservations, which I'd highly recommend.\\n\\nI love that they kick off the meal with a complementary basket of warm pita bread and dipping sauce. Be careful not to fill up on the bread though, as the best is yet to come.\\n\\nFor the entree, I ordered the M'tabaq (salmon over a round of eggplant in a tomato-based sauce), which was delicious and unlike anything I'd seen before. It was well-cooked and juicy and the sauce complemented the dish nicely.\\n\\nNote that they only take four credit cards maximum, so plan accordingly if you have a big group.\\n\\nAll in all, truly inspired cuisine that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else and definitely one of the best restaurants in Sunnyvale.\", u\"Oh, I'm loving it! The food is super delicious! My brother and I ordered take-out foods, the food portions was huge--great for sharing! The following food we ordered are:\\n\\nChicken Shawarma: grilled chicken, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, greens, garlic yogurt $9.95\\nEggplant Falafel: falafel, grilled eggplant, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, parsley, tahini $10.95\\nMansaf: tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt $16.95\\nBaklava: Assortment of traditional baklava pastries. Layers of thin filo dough, nuts, and honey. $7.60\\nMango Lassi: Mango yogurt (price unknown, not on the menu)\\n\\nPros:\\n--foods are delish\\n--huge portions for take out\\n\\nCons:\\n--price is pretty pricey\\n--long waiting for pick up foods\\n\\nI want to come back to eat inside the restaurant and try other dishes.\", u'This restaurant stradles that fine line between \"nice dinner restaurant\" and \"work lunch spot.\"    \\n\\nI ordered the combo kabob plate (chicken and steak) and it was good....definitely a step above the kind of fast food lunch spots.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is right in Downtown Sunnyvale and there are plenty of outside seating.   The prices are a bit on the high side for what you get and I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to eat here but if you are in Downtown Sunnyvale it\\'s definitely a solid option', u\"Had a great dinner with a large group of friends last night. They take reservations and can accomodate larger groups in a back room seating area.\\n\\nI love the pita bread and dip they bring for the table. I ended up ordering the mezzeh for 2 appetizer as my entree. It was good, but I think slightly overpriced for what it is. My boyfriend ordered the zahra lamb shank, and it was delicious! After tax / tip, he paid about $30 just for that dish, but it was worth every bite. It's huge though, so come hungry or share with someone!\", u'A nice place for an evening dinner date. For no special reason, my husband wanted to have a \"date night.\" We read the wonderful reviews on their Mansaf(tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt) and Beriani (tender cubes of beef, potatoes, raisins, garbanzo beans, aged yogurt)..so that is what we had. We loved it!\\nWe ordered the Maza Sampler, however, it came after our main entr\\xe9e. Our server was very apologetic and even provided it gratis. It made a difference because considering it was our first time there, we definitely didn\\'t want to have a poor impression of the place considering many people on Yelp have said that service has deteriorated. We hope to return soon and bring along some friends.', u\"4.5 stars with over a thousand reviews is reserved only for legends (like Phil's BBQ and Sushi Gen) and good ice cream places (who can say no to sugar, cream, creative flavors, long lines, and blissful ice cream food porn).\\n\\nDespite being spoiled by the culinary mecca of SF, ever since I found out about the legendary DishDash I've been on my marks, get set, DASH. With extensive menu full of exotic-sounding dishes, I looked forward to finally venturing beyond my typical shawarma-falafel-kebab cycle.\\n\\nShish Taouk ($15) cubes of charbroiled, free-range chicken, seasonal vegetables || I sometimes consider myself quasi-vegetarian, but that thought goes down in flames whenever I encounter something like DishDash kebabs (or pork belly, my greatest weakness). The juicy/tenderness is balanced with a just-right slightly charred surface at yakitori perfection. With the rich chicken taste, I wouldn't doubt their brag about free-range. They take care in grilling veggies too so it's not a burnt soggy mess of onions and bell peppers like most places; however it would have been ice to have more than 3 pieces of broccoli.\\n\\nSabanech ($16) slow-cooked lamb w/ spinach, black-eyed beans, onions || It's slow-cooked to melt-in-your-mouth lamb. I expected a flavor explosion of pungent spices, but it turned out to be a rather simple cooking style. Basic lamb stew. (Basic in a good sense)\\n\\nBeriani Dajaj ($15)  thinly sliced chicken breast, potatoes, raisins, garbanzo beans, aged yogurt || Yes! I love yogurt because it is guilt-free cream sauce. That being said, mixing the chicken and yogurt sauce into the rice makes a hearty and memorable meal. The golden raisins add an interesting contrast--one of those additions that you are initially hesitant about, but turns out to be overall delicious and makes you speculate if it's one of those spins that food critics praise in their sophisticated reviews. The shis taouk is to die for, but the beriani dajaj is perhaps my favorite dish because it was so unique.\\n\\nEntrees come with a choice of carbs. The basmati rice is richly flavored with tumeric and other spices, as evidenced with the bright yellow hue. The freekeh (apparently seasonal per the menu) may sound funny but it was tasty--somewhat like a brown rice whole grain quinoa.\\n\\nAll the food was absolutely delicious and inhaled with very minimal conversation.\\n\\nWith my totes fan girl review, you are probably wondering why 4 stars. I hate to be negative and knock off stars based on service, but our server was terribly condescending. I don't know if she was annoyed that we didn't order appetizers (entree portions were huge though... sheeeesh kebabs), that we just had waters, or if she was upset that I was mispronouncing names of dishes while ordering. She didn't bring or even offer the complimentary pita bread and dip (Yelpers tell me I'm not missing out, but the aesthetic pita in the wooden bowl would have given me better food pics). Ohs wells. Maybe the servers at the Milpitas location will be less angsty when we come here for lunch and only order $15 entrees.... after all, it's MilPITAs :3\", u'First, let me say the food and service are great, and if I have to be out in the \\'burbs, DishDash is great and has a ton of vegetarian options.\\n\\nBut two things bugged me on our recent visit: 1) The menu now has \"18% gratuity appreciated\" printed on it, which was very presumptuous and put me off -- I normally tip 20-25%, but it\\'s the attitude that I found obnoxious. 2) We were seated in the bar area, which has THREE huge TVs with sports playing -- on a Saturday night! It really ruined the atmosphere. However, the restaurant has 4 large rooms, plus outdoor seating, so I would just request a table away from the TVs, especially if you\\'re planning to enjoy a romantic dinner.\\n\\nGetting that out of the way, I\\'ve been here several times and the service has always been friendly and impeccable. Even if you eat a lot of Mediterranean food (I do!), DishDash has flavors that are inventive and unusual, with authentic ingredients that aren\\'t often found at other places (freekeh, for instance). Even the \"traditional\" items like babaganuj and tabbouleh are of higher quality than one typically finds at Mediterranean restaurants. I\\'ve never had a bad dish here.  \\n\\nThere is a whole section of vegetarian entrees, and most of the appetizers are veg as well. Get the meza platter so that you can sample all of the apps. Even the salads are top-notch. Just come try it, especially on a warm day so you can sit outside.', u\"Oh my goodness, still having flashbacks about how delicious this place was.\\n\\nIf you are anything like me and love Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, DishDash is the place for you. With a large menu, friendly service, and lovely atmosphere, it will please even the pickiest eater.\\n\\nWe started out with the complimentary warm pita bread with dip and some Cab, ($14 a glass) and didn't feel rushed at all which was perfect. While everything looked good, I opted to order the Zahra, which was braised lamb shank with cauliflower in an aged yogurt sauce served with your choice of either rice or freekeh. Wanting to try something new I ordered the freekeh (best described as buckwheat, and was a bit bland for my tastebuds) and realized a couple bites later I should have went for the rice, but it wasn't a huge deal.\\n\\nThe dish itself was exquisite. The lamb was so tender, flavorful, and rich, exactly the way lamb shank should taste. No gaminess, and just the right balance of spices. The cauliflower made for a wonderful accompaniment, the creamy yogurt sauce was seasoned perfectly. The people at my table who had a bite off my plate tried to come back for more so I had to fend them off lol!  \\n\\nWe did go for dessert and ordered Arabic coffee and Kenafeh (which btw takes about 15 to prepare to if you're short on time could be something to consider!) My friends both obsessed over the Kenafeh but honestly I thought it was pretty dry and uninteresting and would probably go with a different desert next time but that is just me! The coffee on the other hand was delicious.\\n\\nOverall I was a happy camper. This place is not cheap but makes up for it in quality. There is something here for everyone :)\", u'Pretty cool ambience (esp around the long table facing the bar). They have good appetizers like most other Mediterranean place but what makes the difference is their entree. They have such big portions of entrees that you will be stuffed. They also have no meat-no eggs entree which is delicious as well.', u\"Food here is pretty good. Service is not good when it is busy.\\n\\nWe had beriani dejaj and lamb bamei. The beriani dejaj is so creamy and good. I wish I had that instead of the lamb bamei I got. Its only because I don't like lamb.\", u\"We found this place on Yelp due to the high reviews. Over 2000 reviews and 4.5 stars is very credible and seemed like a no brainer for us on our first night up in the Bay Area.  We had the gambari and falafels for appetizer which I both recommend. For dinner we had the sambusak, which was really tasty. I love the Mediterranean flavored as they are unique compared to other cuisines. The restaurant seemed like easily the best option on a cool Murphy street. They were packed as expected so be prepared to wait or come at a less busy time. The servers did a great job at fitting is in quickly and even moved us from a two to four person table when my cousin decided to come. I wish we had a restaurant like this in the San Diego area. The high reviews don't lie and you shouldn't be let down.\", u'6/11/15: Came here for lunch today and was impressed!  It was a little confusing cause there\\'s a popular chain called \"Dish n Dash\" which apparently is not the same thing.  But, after looking them up, I guess it\\'s all owned by the same folks, and the \"n\" version is kinda their fast-foodish offshoot.  I\\'ve been to Dish n Dash too, and it tastes good, but prices were almost offensively high.  Here prices are still a little expensive but the food is fancier and it\\'s a nice restaurant so I think it\\'s more justified.\\n\\n1. Pineapple-coconut juice $3.5: Very nice drink.  Syrupy with good coconut flavor.  I\\'m not the hugest fan of coconut, but it\\'s very well balanced in this drink.  Kinda wish I could taste more pineapple, but I dunno, maybe it wouldn\\'t be as good.  Decent price for the quality.  7/10.\\n\\n2. Mansaf $16.95: The dish they serve it on is large and the pile of rice and stewed lamb is served on a bed of creamy yellow sauce that fills the entire plate.  I would say the rice and lamb fills about a medium-sized bowl.  Love the sauce--can\\'t really place the dominant flavor, but it\\'s really rich and yummy.  Rice is good.  The lamb is very tender and has a good amount of fat, making it taste pretty good.  Might be a tad expensive for what you get, but heck, it tastes really good.  9/10.\\n\\nI\\'d love to come back.  Never had anything like that mansaf before.  I dunno if I just never went to any good middle eastern places, but so far this place is the best I\\'ve tried based on my limited selection of stuff.\\n\\nOne thing to note: our service was horrible.  After serving us the food outside I couldn\\'t find a server anymore to ask for water.  People were nice enough, but it\\'s just that there were no waiters to be found.\\n\\nFor now... 5/5.\\n\\n#middleeastern #mediterranean', u\"Vegetarians and omnivores alike will delight in this restaurant.  We had a vegetarian among our party of four last night at DishDash and he really enjoyed having so many dishes to choose from for dinner!\\n\\nWe started with the Maza Platter for 4. I often find baba ganoush and hummus pretty bland in most Middle Eastern restaurants, but the hummus and baba ganoush here were very tasty. Seasoning was perfect and they were wonderful slathered on pita bread.  I especially liked the Rihan app. It has grilled eggplant, tomatoes, basil and fresh feta. So delicious. If you're an eggplant lover like me, you will love this app.  I didn't eat as much of the pita bread as my husband as I wanted to have room and enjoy my main entree!\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered the same thing--the Mansaf. I ordered a Kebab dish the first time we ate here a few years ago. I'm so glad I ordered the Mansaf this time. Delicious!!!! I loved how flavorful the dish was. The lamb was tender, the rice and yogurt sauce were tasty and loved the crunch from the slivered almonds. The hubby ordered and loved Lamb Shank dish with tomatoes and onions. I tasted his lamb and it was very good too. I think my dish was better though. :). My friend's husband ordered the falafel dish with tomatoes and onions, and it must have been good 'cause he wiped it clean.\\n\\nWe did not have dessert unfortunately. We had no room in our tummies. For beverages, I had the lemonade with mint. It was a little too sweet for me, so I added some water to tone down the sweetness. My friend had a pineapple juice mix and she really like it too.\\n\\nWe'll have to come back here. The food was fabulous. Service was great and the ambience was nice. This is an extremely popular restaurant, so make a reservation! They had heat lamps outside so you can eat alfresco even at night. They also accommodate big groups.\", u'Oh Dish Dash, I finally got to try you and you let me down in multiple ways\\n\\n4 of us went to Dish Dash we had reservations thank God, I heard this place was smallish and always busy and in fact to busy. The host took us to a table inside and disappeared. We looked over our menu\\'s and he came back asking about drinks, so ice tea and water appeared on our table and a small basket of Peta bread and a dipping plate. The bread was gone in about 2 mins... Yes we have 4 people at the table not 2, bring us a bigger thing of bread !! So as we wait for someone to take our order, and then wait, and then wait even more the waiter comes by and we asked 3 different people for more bread !!  Only the bus boy came through for us... Now we order some Hummus and dinner and wait.\\n\\nThe Hummus appears, but no bread, we are out, please bring us more bread !! 5 mins later more bread appears and we have to ask, can we get more water and so on you get the idea, so I will cut this short, the thing that pissed me off the most was at the end of the dinner, when they pick up your plates pretty fast, I am guessing to get you out the door to get the next round of people in, a lady comes to our table and asks us would you like to see the desert menu?  I look and her and say \" Yes Please, it\\'s her B Day \" and she smiles at me only to never be seen again ( WTH ) and no menu, 5 to 10 mins later our waiter comes by and asks if we want to see the desert menu.. OMG Epic Fail..... Bad Bad Bad Dish Dash...\\n\\nPRO:\\nFood is good and lots of choices\\n\\nCON:\\nWay to busy..\\nWay to over booked..\\nBread basket is the same for single or 4 / 6 people\\nStaff is way to over worked or just fails at remembering what you asked for...\\nWait for almost everything just ended up making us ask, was it really worth coming to a place like this, since we were ready to bail out the door a few times and just hit Kabuls a few blocks down!!\\nTends to rune birthday moments ( thank you so much for that ) !!! So please don\\'t bring anyone here for special event', u\"JIZZ IN YOUR PANTS GOOD. No kidding.\\n\\nOrder the Mansaf!\\n\\nI had a special moment with one of the lamb dishes that I haven't encountered before at this restaurant. It seems like everyone in the South bay and their mom have been here at least once, since its known as one of the finest restaurants to visit in the Sunnyvale area.\\n\\nRESERVATION SITUATION\\nDecided to have dinner here after 8:30 pm (they close at 9:30) on a Thursday, without reservations, with my mom. When we arrived, the place was swarming with patrons. In spite of the seemingly packed venue, my mom and I were seated at a table in approx. 15 minutes. We were fortunate at that moment, but I highly recommend that you make reservations at least a day or two in advance, as this restaurant has become increasingly popular over the years.\\n\\nFEELING ADVENTUROUS\\nIn the past, I had always resorted to ordering their savory kabob dishes, but when I visited for dinner during this particular evening, I was feeling some of that 'Yelper boldness', so I decided to ask our server for his entr\\xe9e recommendation. With no hesitation, he eagerly advised me to order the Mansaf and I went for it. All entrees come with your choice of Freekeh, or basmati rice topped with sliced, toasted almonds.\\n\\nENTREES & DESSERT\\n+ MANSAF $18.95: Mmm, my palate felt pampered by the silky melody of exceptionally delicate lamb, slow-cooked in aged yogurt, with almond-topped basmati rice. Friggen brilliant. Rice was perfectly cooked and the yogurt was super flavorful. My only gripe was that the small chunks of lamb were extremely tender, rapidly melting in my mouth, so the meat's flavor quickly got lost in the rich, abundant yogurt sauce. I only wish that the lamb flavor was a little more outstanding, or perhaps I wish the chunks of lamb were larger. Don't fret---there really IS lamb in the dish. The small chunks of lamb are HIDDEN inside the dome of basmati rice! 0.o More lamb flavor though, please Dish Dash. :/\\n\\n+ MASHWI $24.95: SHIEET, I didn't have the chance to mooch off my mom's dish, because she immediately scarfed it down, so she was obviously impressed by her order (Marinated, grilled sea bass, prawns, and seasonal vegetables).\\n\\nWe ended the night with the 'Cho-kolata' lava cake with ice cream $8.00, which we don't particularly recommend. I'm a total dessert fiend, but the elementary ingredients were anything but unique. I could've purchased a cheap tub of ice cream and pre-packaged lava cake from Safeway and my rendition of this Cho-kolata dessert would be just as mediocre.\\n\\nDRINK RECOMMENDATIONS\\nTheir drink menu, especially their wine list, is pretty extensive. Per our server's recommendation, I ordered the Zanzabeel (ginger, apple juice, mint, ginger beer, Michter's Sour Mash Whiskey). All cocktails are $10.00. If you enjoy ginger and mint, then you'll appreciate this drink. My mom ordered the Terre Rouge Syrah $11.00. We thoroughly savored our drinks. They also serve draft and bottled beer and single malt scotch.\\n\\nVENUE\\nI really, really dig the bustling locale. A 'Cocktail Happy Hour,' chill kind of crowd. It's kinda loud inside, so you may have to shout at your dinner companion. I'm considering adding this restaurant to my 'Make the Panties Drop' list. Although the venue isn't exactly romantic, you could still possibly make her panties drop with the acclaimed 'authenticity' of the dishes here and the wonderful ambiance. Saw some dude at the table next to us caressing a woman's arm and it looked like she was pretty amused. Get it in, bro.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nFriendly service is satisfactory (15% solid tip), but not worth the 18% tip that the restaurant recommends/appreciates. Call me cheap or finicky, but I wasn't charmed.\\n\\nVERDICT\\nOverall, a solid four-star restaurant. I deducted one star merely because the flavors of the dishes here don't surpass the flavors I've encountered with dishes that cost less at other restaurants I've been to. Nevertheless, delicious food. In my opinion, you're essentially paying more $$ here for their 'fresher' ingredients, delightful ambiance, and neater presentation.\\n\\n+ Vegetarian options\\n+ Catering is available\\n+ Street parking and Macy's parking lot\", u'Excellent everything! Perfect service. Delicious food. First time here and I love it. Attentive waiter. Helped us figure out the menu. Good quality food. A bit pricy but worth it. Love the d\\xe9cor.', u\"Probably the best resto in Sunnyvale if not the South Bay. I've tried everything but the lamb (ugh). The fattoush salad is easily shared by 4 people.  The beef and chicken kebabs w/veggies are delicious as is the  Mashwi (grilled seabass & prawns w/veggies.  A bit different is the Shakshuka (prawns in an eggplant and tomato sauce).  Unless you want to wait for hours (or be turned away) make reservations.  Consistently good food and service.\", u\"Honestly, i could even say 4.5. I have been to many Persian restaurants before, and was expecting a nice koobideh, but was very surprised when I opened the menu and saw lots of unknown dishes. I asked the waiter and he recommended the Mansaf - slow cooked lamb over basmati rice covered with aged yogurt - and it was delicious! This dish was incredible - full of spices and flavor, and incredibly unique. I also tried my friends tabsi (another dish i've never tried before) and another uniquely spiced dish. The service here was also very great. I asked for 1/2 rice 1/2 freekah (quinoa type), but he recommended the rice and gave me a small side of freekah to try for free, which I found to be incredibly nice. We also got the kunafah, but I found it to be less sweet than I have had in other places. I will be back here for sure.\", u\"Being Palestinian, it's pretty hard to impress us when eating middle eastern foods. But honestly, everything we ate was on point. You can taste the quality of the food. Very tasty!!!! Oh downfall was the timing between appetizers and main meals. It took a while.\", u\"Best place in the South Bay! Excellent service and great ambience. I love the lamb dishes, especially the Lamb Masaf and the Shih Tahouk.\\nUsually, I start with a vodka martini and continue with a nice Malbec. Don't miss the chocolate lava cake. It's prepared fresh, so it's recommended to order it 15-30 minutes in advance.\", u'Went here last week and the food was great. We had to wait 20-25 mins to get seated.\\n\\nThey used modern tech to alert us via text messages when the seats were available, which was cool. Our server was attentive enough. It was understandable because the restaurant was full at the time. We had to wait quite a long time for a check at the end. The guys who gave food and cleaned up our table were very polite and seemed to be more attentive than our own server, who returned the wrong check afterwards lol. Anyway, understandable.\\n\\nAbout the food, dry but tasty. I had Teka Kebab which was ordered as medium well. They came out perfectly. The beef was great, reasonably seasoned. I like how they made the vege. Nice dressing with broccoli. Coming with the dish was a green and sour sauce. Oh, speaking of sauce, the one they gave us at the start with the bread... it tasted so weird... oily and bland.. but I believed that was made from some kind of ethnic herbs.... anyway, it was strange. maybe it was supposed to taste like that. Not a big fan, but glad that I tried.\\n\\nIn terms of pricing, it was good. I came out full and satisfied so that was good.', u\"I love Mediterranean food, but unfortunately that often means just hummus and falafel- this restaurant offers a wider range of meal options- which are super tasty! They serve bread first with a strange sesame seed dipping sauce, which I thought tasted kind of weird. I ordered the M'shakaleh, which was sooo good and unlike anything I've ever tasted. My friend got the shakshuka, which was different than other shakshuka's I've had, and was just ok. I really like the environment of this restaurant as well- I will be back!\", u'DISHDASH IS HOME TO THE BEST FALAFELS YOU WILL EVER HAVE.\\n\\nFreshly baked, out of the oven. Or are they fried? Whatever.\\nAwesome. (This is my favorite adjective to describe things I like.)\\nLovely. You will fall in love.\\nAngelic. If you go to heaven, you\\'ll be able to eat these forever.\\nFluffy!\\nEdible. Very, very edible.\\nLegitimate. You might think, \"Holy !@#$, I can\\'t believe it\\'s not falafels!\"\\n\\n...but oh yes, it is falafels.\\n\\nP.S. Everything else is good, too!', u\"Oh DishDash. You're my go to for beriani.\\n\\nFOOD - I always get the beriani dajaj (chicken, potatoes, almond slivers, raisins, beans, and aged-yogurt with rice) and it never does me wrong. As for the Sabanech (lamb shank, spinach, beans)... I enjoyed the lamb but was not a fan of the spinach and bean mixture. A bit too drenched.\\n\\nAMBIANCE - It's a nice atmosphere with dimmed lighting. Crowded often, even on random Wednesday nights. However, I don't enjoy how close the tables in the middle are together. You can hear the conversations of the people next to you if you're quiet.\\n\\nOTHER - I love that they text you when your table is ready so you can walk around without a big buzzer, there is complimentary warm pita bread and the great service.\", u\"It's always nice to get out of your comfort zone and try something out of the ordinary. Thank you to my girLs for accompanying me to this spot!!\\n\\nLong Lines outside is a great indication that there's something magical going on inside. This is a tiny location that gets pretty packed quickly so come prepared for a possibLe wait.\\nDishDash offers a vast menu and is guaranteed to satisfy even your pickiest eaters.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\nMaza SampLer for 4\\nBeriani- Beef with aged yogurt sauce\\nMashwi- Seabass + Prawns\\nM'Sakhan- Chicken wrapped in crust w/saffron yogurt\\nCho-KoLata- Choc Lava Cake\\nKenafeh- FiLodough + Cheese dessert\\n\\nFirst off, the complimentary pita and dip is amazeballs. I had to force myself to stop eating it in order to make room for all the food we ordered.\\nMasa Mediterranean SampLer is a must. A smorgasbord of delicious dips to get your tastebuds warmed up.\\nBeriani had chunks of beef cooked with potatoes, almonds, & raisins cooked in a yogurt sauce. Normally I'm not a fan of cooked raisins but I define made an acception with this. Creamy sauce that was not overbearing.\\nPresentation for the M'Sakhan is a jaw dropper. It's like a delicious edible present that you just can't wait to open. Crispy on the outside and moist cooked chicken on the inside.\\nCho-KoLata is your typical Lava cake- Nothing too thrilling. Kenafeh on the other hand is out of this world!! BeautifuL and deLicious with its crispy exterior and cheesy interior that isn't overwhelmingLy sweet.\\n\\nI will most definitely be back to try a few other dishes. Keep up the great work DishDash :)\", u\"I'm always baffled by the crowds at Dish Dash. I have tried going there five times. Each time, the food has not been good; the service has been marginal three of those five times. One time, the food was so salty as to be inedible. Another time, a hot dish arrived at room temperature. At every visit, I've ordered classic dishes that I've had elsewhere. And always DishDash's preparation has been inferior. I have always gone to this restaurant with other people and they've almost always been disappointed in their dinners.\\n\\nPerhaps the large portion sizes are the draw at DishDash? There are so many restaurants on Murphy Street, including a competitor across the street where the food is far better and the service is appropriately attentive.\", u'If you love lamb as I do, the Sabanech is a must have. Slow cooked lamb, spinach, black-eyed beans, onions.  Subtle yet sublime.', u'Let\\'s talk about the best beriani I\\'ve ever had. OK, I rarely eat beriani and I\\'m still confused about whether \"beriani\" is just an alternative name for what we all know as biryani. It doesn\\'t matter because I\\'m not a regular consumer of either. Anyway, DishDash\\'s Beriani Dajaj is simply phenomenal. Actually, all of their dishes are well executed with generous portions and fragrant flavors.\\n\\nWhile the rest of Murphy Street is quiet and ho-hum, you will find bustling crowds waiting outside of DishDash. Make a reservation if you can. If you\\'re not able to, try to swing by during non-primetime hours.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 on a Saturday night but we actually showed up an hour beforehand. Since we didn\\'t hit the dinner rush yet, the hostess was able to accommodate our early arrival. (You can say that we were just REALLY excited to try DishDash...or just terrible with time management.)\\n\\nThe venue is deceptively big and unexpectedly romantic/intimate. We were led to our table in a room near the back. A server plopped down a basket of pita bread and some type of dipping sauce. DON\\'T make the same silly mistake as I did and fill up on the pita bread--as tempting as it is (and they offer free refills).\\n\\nI\\'m a huge fan of Chimay and was pleasantly surprised to find that DishDash carries this beer. First thing we ordered! Priorities.\\n\\nAfter taking some sips, we opted for the following:  \\n\\n*Falafels - crispy blend of organic garbanzo beans with tahini sauce. One of my friends recommended DishDash solely based on their amazing falafels, and they ARE amazing. A crunchy exterior with a moist and grainy center, it can proudly stand as a one-man show on its own, or a harmonious duo with the tahini sauce as well.\\n\\n*Kufta Kebab with Freekah - minced beef and lamb with blended herbs and seasonal vegetables (Brussels sprouts, carrots, tomatoes, onions). Essentially beef and lamb sausages...but to the next level of deliciousness! The dish comes with a zesty green sauce, perfect for dipping the kebabs. The entrees are paired with either Basmati Rice or Freekah; the latter piqued our interest. It\\'s similar to couscous and a lovely base for the kebab.\\n\\n*Beriani Dajaj - thinly sliced chicken breast, potatoes, raisins, and garbanzo beans, served with Basmati rice (or Freekah). The ingredients sit in a massive plate of aged yogurt. Oh man. This yogurt. It is rich, creamy, and so addicting. The raisins add a splendidly sweet twist. You must order this! Fantastic. Like I said, it\\'s the best beriani I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nThe service is prompt, attentive, and friendly. The meals might be a bit spendy but definitely worth it for the quality of food. DishDash is my new South Bay favorite!', u\"I've been here several times and have been soo impressed every time. If you're craving some yummy ethnic food, look no further! DishDash has got you covered ;)\\n\\nI've ordered their sausages, kabobs, and seabass/prawn dishes. Service is quick and everything I've ordered has been delicious.\\n\\nOnly problem I had was last time I went, they gave us a dessert menu but left us stranded for half an hour while we waited for them to take our order. By then we decided to grab the check instead of wait longer.\", u\"I just love this place . Party in my mouth.  I am so lucky to be living close, walking distance to it . Unfortunately it's so crowded all the time and I am not very patient  , not 45 minutes to wait for food . The times I went, I was there right at 5pm to be seated ASAP and right when they open for lunch too .\\nMaybe it's better , it gives me more time for my food to digest before the end of the day.\", u\"DishDash is absolutely delicious and amazing!\\n\\nWe came here on a busy Saturday morning, sat by the street-side and peopled gazed as the weekly farmer's market was going on.(Such a fun way to take it all in and enjoy a sunny Saturday)!\\n\\nAnyway, ambiance aside, we dived into the menu! We started with a humus platter (it was so flavorful and not salty) topped with pickled veggies. Then we ordered the chicken shawarma wrap, Beriani Dajaj (chicken breast cooked in yogurt based sauce) served with rice, and M'shakaleh Vegetarian (beautifully layered vegetables served in yogurt based sauce) over rice. Oh they were all excellent! The yogurt based sauce has great acidity (#topchefreference) but not overwhelming. The portion was generous and just right for three people.\\n\\nIt's been two days since our fabulous lunch at DishDash, and I already wanna go back! Can't wait for the next time!\", u\"I hadn't tried many Mediterranean dishes before trying Dish Dash, and I am very impressed! Since I don't like lamb, I got the Beef Kebab and it was AMAZING. The beef is cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce and fluffy rice make this dish ON POINT. I don't normally like the vegetables that they had but it wasn't bad with the sauce.\\nAlso, my sister got the chicken kebab and it was also cooked perfectly. The chicken was juicy and not dry at all.\\nThe price of the dishes are a little expensive but it will fill you up!  \\n\\nDefinitely give this place a try :)\", u\"My girlfriend was in town visiting and her favorite cuisine happens to be Mediterranean food. After a Yelp search for Mediterranean food sorted by ratings and also some of word of mouth cross-referencing with trusted friends, DishDash was the chosen restaurant for our date on Saturday night. I called ahead to make a reservation because from what I've seen, the place is usually packed.\\n\\nOn the day of, we were running late and I called again 2 hours before our reservation to push it back and the staff was more than accommodating. We ordered a glass of Park Station Pinot Noir and munched on some of the pita bread while deciding what to order. Based on the waiter's recommendation, we went with the beriani dejaj and shish taouk (chicken kebab). I was extremely impressed with the food and the quality of the chicken. The chicken kebab was cooked absolutely perfectly - tender and white on the inside and still blackened and crisp on the outside. It had a great zesty flavor to it which made eating it with the basmati rice and steamed broccoli a satisfying experience. The beriani also had succulent chicken but I really enjoyed the aged yogurt of this dish. It was unique and I am really glad I ordered it because I wasn't too sure what to expect. The topping of raisins/almonds gave the dish a nice crunch as well. The portions are huge so this was more than enough food for us. I took the leftovers home and had it for lunch the next day and it was still just as delicious. I'll be back here again for sure.\", u\"I'm apparently late to the DishDash party.\\n\\nMost of my South Bay friends on yelp had been to DishDash and what a great thing that is! ;-)  I don't even need to do extensive research. (that's a lie, I studied the menu the night before!)\\n\\nThe place feels a bit claustrophobic with the weird set-up: an awkward hostess stand right in front of the entrance, a smallish/narrow dining section right behind the wall and then to the right, it opens to a larger dining room which also houses the bar area.\\nDefinitely make a reservation because even on a Tuesday night, this place was packed.\\n\\nI had the Bamieh which is slow-cooked lamb with grilled okra, tomatoes, onions and garlic. I love the combination of these flavors as they constitute a more hearty, comforting base for the fall-off-the-bone lamb!  I accompanied this with pickled veggies just to cut through the acidity of the dish.  My friends' entrees also tasted good: the Mashwi with the large prawns and the Mo, king of Kebab with tender beef cubes.\\n\\nDowntown Sunnyvale may only be 2 blocks long, but this restaurant scores big in my book. I'm excited for a return visit.\", u'I had the Bamieh, a slow-cooked lamb dish with okra, tomato sauce and onions, very tender and delicious. I savored and finished the soupy sauce before even venturing into the nice size lamb shank on well presented plate. The rice was yummy and perfect with this dish.\\n\\nThis was our second visit to DishDash and we were not disappointed. The ambiance was nice and relaxing, not overly loud or crowded and nice energy. The service was very efficient. We ordered our food fairly quickly and started out with a healthy stack of Pita bread to complement our appetizer, the Maza platter which was really flavorful! I like the  olives and hummus on my pita. Even our vegetarian friend  was happy with the selection of vegetarian food options here.\\n\\nMy wife had the Mansaf, which looked wonderful with the pyramid shape of rice surrounded by the soupy mote of yogurt to cool things down. Next time I will order the Mansaf since I did get to tast it and it was fabulous! We were not rushed and the servers were attentive but not overly so which was perfect. I like the lighting and feel of the place which was cozy and warm.\\n\\nThey have tables outside with heat lamps so next dinner here, we will sit outside and enjoy the night with Mediterranean food at DishDash in Sunnyvale. The prices were fair I thought for the quality of food and experience, overall.', u'Hit this place up for lunch on a Friday and it was super busy. Normally, I dislike crowded places, but it was easy to see the service was top-notch, not-stop hustling to get orders out so we took a chance. It also helped that we opted to sit at the bar to cut down on the wait and got our food within 15-20 minutes.\\n\\nI ordered the beriani with beef (more unique, but pricier, ~$16) based on Yelp reviews and my date got the lamb shwarma with a side of fries (cheaper and good value, ~$12, definitely very hearty). Everything was on point: well-seasoned, large portions, but what really stands out is the meat! Extremely moist and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you like meat tender and juicy, this is a prime spot for grubbing!', u'What can I say about a place with 2000+ reviews averaging to 4.5 stars. Clearly this place is a gem. It does get crowded during peak lunch hours but they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and you get helped pretty quickly.\\n\\nThe food was definitely one of the best mediterranean food I have had. My friend and I got the Shish Kebab and Shish Taouk plate. The portions were quite large and our waitress was super nice and friendly. I like the fact that the service was good even during crowded hours. Will definitely come back again.', u'This is my second time visiting Dishdash. Never a disappointment but always full of people.\\n\\nRECOMMENDED SALAD\\nLamb Shawarma salad\\nThe proportion of Matt and green is just perfect. Very juicy lamb but not too overwhelming, thanks to the garlic Greek yogurt sauce. Highly recommended.', u\"Overall: very tasty, reasonably priced, long wait, don't go on a summer Wednesday (unless you like huge drunken crowds and deafening music).\\n\\nFuture self, please get:\\n- Rihan Appetizer: grilled eggplant, tomatoes, almond basil, feta ($8) - the pine nuts added a delicious crunch!\\n- Chicken Shawarma Appetizer: thinly sliced chicken, grilled onions, hummus ($9) - basically a hummus dish with some chicken thrown on top - but hearty and tasty nonetheless\\n- Mansaf Entree: tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt ($19) - sauce was delicious, lamb was so so tender (not a ton of meat on the plate) - yet the sauce is thick enough that it's very filling! Highly recommend!\\n- Shish Taouk Entree: cubes of charbroiled, free-range chicken breast, seasonal vegetables ($18) The chicken was extremely moist and perfectly cooked! Rice and broccoli were filler foods.\\n\\nThis was the perfect amount of food for 4 people (2 apps, 2 entrees).\\n\\nRecommend! Looking forward to returning :)\", u'Back in high school, I remember walking by a classmate in Ms. Bragg\\'s English class as he was regaling people around him with the story of how his entire basketball team managed to pull an IHOP dine-and-dash.  Now, I was a very, very sheltered kid and had to ask him afterward to define \"dine-and-dash.\"  When he did, I think I shot him a withering look (my first job was at a family owned Chinese restaurant, and I definitely wouldn\\'t have appreciated customers walking out without paying the bill).\\n\\nA decade+ later (my how time flies)!, I couldn\\'t help but think about that interaction when my good friend, Jacque C., mentioned that she had made dinner reservations for our mutual friend\\'s surprise birthday party at DishDash.\\n\\nAnother thing about me, I\\'m not very good with surprises - receiving them, planning them, etc.  It just messes with my whole control freak streak.  To make a long story short, after having to ruin the surprise in order to get our hangry friend from beque to DishDash, we arrived half an hour past our reservation.  I called on our drive over and the woman on the phone said that while she had already given up our table, she would try her best to seat us when we arrived.  When we finally arrived, the restaurant was packed (what do you expect on a Saturday night?), and I had to wade through a large group of people standing right inside the front door to get to the hostesses.  The hostess I spoke to was true to her word, and graciously managed to seat us within 10 minutes of getting there - awesome!\\n\\nAt this point, all of us hangry Type A gals had our noses in our menus, fuming a little about being late.  Luckily for us, we had a really attentive waiter who seemed to sense impending danger and swooped in with fresh pita bread and an olive oil based dipping sauce.  Thank you, thank you.  By the time he circled back around to take our order, we had wolfed it all down and a passing busboy came around with another plate.\\n\\nSince my brain had yet to register the wads of pita bread heading down my esophagus, I asked for the maza sampler for 4, confident that we could polish all of that off.  Our waiter smiled and talked me down from the 4-person ledge to the 2, reassuring me that it was plenty.  For a split second my competitive side reared forward and I heard myself say, \"Just because we\\'re tiny Asian girls doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t eat!\"  Oy vey.  As soon as that sentenced actually registered in my brain, I cringed, mumbled my dinner order, and stuck another piece of pita bread in my trap.\\n\\nTen minutes or so later, pita bread sitting pretty in my tummy, the maza sampler arrived and I was so glad the waiter made the recommendation he did.  We BARELY finished everything, and once we did, we regretted ordering an appetizer altogether since our dinner entree servings were equally as generous.  I wanted to cry because I couldn\\'t finish my plateful of deliciously tender and perfectly seasoned tika kebab over fluffy basmati rice.\\n\\nMaybe some of y\\'all know that horrible, horrible feeling of being absolutely STUFFED and still wanting to shovel down food.  Oh well.  I think at that point i knew I would have died and gone to heaven perfectly content.\\n\\nJust thinking about the tika kebab as I type this is making my mouth water.  I can\\'t recommend DishDash enough, and I know it\\'s a place I\\'d confidently take my family and friends to.', u\"The food has been consistently delicious every time I've eaten here for dinner, and you'll find some unique middle eastern dishes expertly cooked and presented with intention. Of course, you'd have to be a fan of this type of food to enjoy it. However, I found the flavors quite palatable with spices that are mild enough not to be too scary or intimidating.\\n\\nThe place is almost always full (even on weekdays), so I'd recommend making reservations. For bigger parties above four, they may not have tables until later in the evening like 8pm if you call on the same day. There's also walk-in room, but expect to wait about an hour or more during prime meal times, even though the seating area is decently large. In the past, I've always had reservations, which I'd highly recommend.\\n\\nI love that they kick off the meal with a complementary basket of warm pita bread and dipping sauce. Be careful not to fill up on the bread though, as the best is yet to come.\\n\\nFor the entree, I ordered the M'tabaq (salmon over a round of eggplant in a tomato-based sauce), which was delicious and unlike anything I'd seen before. It was well-cooked and juicy and the sauce complemented the dish nicely.\\n\\nNote that they only take four credit cards maximum, so plan accordingly if you have a big group.\\n\\nAll in all, truly inspired cuisine that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else and definitely one of the best restaurants in Sunnyvale.\", u\"Oh, I'm loving it! The food is super delicious! My brother and I ordered take-out foods, the food portions was huge--great for sharing! The following food we ordered are:\\n\\nChicken Shawarma: grilled chicken, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, greens, garlic yogurt $9.95\\nEggplant Falafel: falafel, grilled eggplant, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, parsley, tahini $10.95\\nMansaf: tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt $16.95\\nBaklava: Assortment of traditional baklava pastries. Layers of thin filo dough, nuts, and honey. $7.60\\nMango Lassi: Mango yogurt (price unknown, not on the menu)\\n\\nPros:\\n--foods are delish\\n--huge portions for take out\\n\\nCons:\\n--price is pretty pricey\\n--long waiting for pick up foods\\n\\nI want to come back to eat inside the restaurant and try other dishes.\", u'This restaurant stradles that fine line between \"nice dinner restaurant\" and \"work lunch spot.\"    \\n\\nI ordered the combo kabob plate (chicken and steak) and it was good....definitely a step above the kind of fast food lunch spots.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is right in Downtown Sunnyvale and there are plenty of outside seating.   The prices are a bit on the high side for what you get and I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to eat here but if you are in Downtown Sunnyvale it\\'s definitely a solid option', u\"Had a great dinner with a large group of friends last night. They take reservations and can accomodate larger groups in a back room seating area.\\n\\nI love the pita bread and dip they bring for the table. I ended up ordering the mezzeh for 2 appetizer as my entree. It was good, but I think slightly overpriced for what it is. My boyfriend ordered the zahra lamb shank, and it was delicious! After tax / tip, he paid about $30 just for that dish, but it was worth every bite. It's huge though, so come hungry or share with someone!\", u'A nice place for an evening dinner date. For no special reason, my husband wanted to have a \"date night.\" We read the wonderful reviews on their Mansaf(tender chunks of lamb slow-cooked in aged yogurt) and Beriani (tender cubes of beef, potatoes, raisins, garbanzo beans, aged yogurt)..so that is what we had. We loved it!\\nWe ordered the Maza Sampler, however, it came after our main entr\\xe9e. Our server was very apologetic and even provided it gratis. It made a difference because considering it was our first time there, we definitely didn\\'t want to have a poor impression of the place considering many people on Yelp have said that service has deteriorated. We hope to return soon and bring along some friends.', u\"4.5 stars with over a thousand reviews is reserved only for legends (like Phil's BBQ and Sushi Gen) and good ice cream places (who can say no to sugar, cream, creative flavors, long lines, and blissful ice cream food porn).\\n\\nDespite being spoiled by the culinary mecca of SF, ever since I found out about the legendary DishDash I've been on my marks, get set, DASH. With extensive menu full of exotic-sounding dishes, I looked forward to finally venturing beyond my typical shawarma-falafel-kebab cycle.\\n\\nShish Taouk ($15) cubes of charbroiled, free-range chicken, seasonal vegetables || I sometimes consider myself quasi-vegetarian, but that thought goes down in flames whenever I encounter something like DishDash kebabs (or pork belly, my greatest weakness). The juicy/tenderness is balanced with a just-right slightly charred surface at yakitori perfection. With the rich chicken taste, I wouldn't doubt their brag about free-range. They take care in grilling veggies too so it's not a burnt soggy mess of onions and bell peppers like most places; however it would have been ice to have more than 3 pieces of broccoli.\\n\\nSabanech ($16) slow-cooked lamb w/ spinach, black-eyed beans, onions || It's slow-cooked to melt-in-your-mouth lamb. I expected a flavor explosion of pungent spices, but it turned out to be a rather simple cooking style. Basic lamb stew. (Basic in a good sense)\\n\\nBeriani Dajaj ($15)  thinly sliced chicken breast, potatoes, raisins, garbanzo beans, aged yogurt || Yes! I love yogurt because it is guilt-free cream sauce. That being said, mixing the chicken and yogurt sauce into the rice makes a hearty and memorable meal. The golden raisins add an interesting contrast--one of those additions that you are initially hesitant about, but turns out to be overall delicious and makes you speculate if it's one of those spins that food critics praise in their sophisticated reviews. The shis taouk is to die for, but the beriani dajaj is perhaps my favorite dish because it was so unique.\\n\\nEntrees come with a choice of carbs. The basmati rice is richly flavored with tumeric and other spices, as evidenced with the bright yellow hue. The freekeh (apparently seasonal per the menu) may sound funny but it was tasty--somewhat like a brown rice whole grain quinoa.\\n\\nAll the food was absolutely delicious and inhaled with very minimal conversation.\\n\\nWith my totes fan girl review, you are probably wondering why 4 stars. I hate to be negative and knock off stars based on service, but our server was terribly condescending. I don't know if she was annoyed that we didn't order appetizers (entree portions were huge though... sheeeesh kebabs), that we just had waters, or if she was upset that I was mispronouncing names of dishes while ordering. She didn't bring or even offer the complimentary pita bread and dip (Yelpers tell me I'm not missing out, but the aesthetic pita in the wooden bowl would have given me better food pics). Ohs wells. Maybe the servers at the Milpitas location will be less angsty when we come here for lunch and only order $15 entrees.... after all, it's MilPITAs :3\", u'First, let me say the food and service are great, and if I have to be out in the \\'burbs, DishDash is great and has a ton of vegetarian options.\\n\\nBut two things bugged me on our recent visit: 1) The menu now has \"18% gratuity appreciated\" printed on it, which was very presumptuous and put me off -- I normally tip 20-25%, but it\\'s the attitude that I found obnoxious. 2) We were seated in the bar area, which has THREE huge TVs with sports playing -- on a Saturday night! It really ruined the atmosphere. However, the restaurant has 4 large rooms, plus outdoor seating, so I would just request a table away from the TVs, especially if you\\'re planning to enjoy a romantic dinner.\\n\\nGetting that out of the way, I\\'ve been here several times and the service has always been friendly and impeccable. Even if you eat a lot of Mediterranean food (I do!), DishDash has flavors that are inventive and unusual, with authentic ingredients that aren\\'t often found at other places (freekeh, for instance). Even the \"traditional\" items like babaganuj and tabbouleh are of higher quality than one typically finds at Mediterranean restaurants. I\\'ve never had a bad dish here.  \\n\\nThere is a whole section of vegetarian entrees, and most of the appetizers are veg as well. Get the meza platter so that you can sample all of the apps. Even the salads are top-notch. Just come try it, especially on a warm day so you can sit outside.', u\"Oh my goodness, still having flashbacks about how delicious this place was.\\n\\nIf you are anything like me and love Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, DishDash is the place for you. With a large menu, friendly service, and lovely atmosphere, it will please even the pickiest eater.\\n\\nWe started out with the complimentary warm pita bread with dip and some Cab, ($14 a glass) and didn't feel rushed at all which was perfect. While everything looked good, I opted to order the Zahra, which was braised lamb shank with cauliflower in an aged yogurt sauce served with your choice of either rice or freekeh. Wanting to try something new I ordered the freekeh (best described as buckwheat, and was a bit bland for my tastebuds) and realized a couple bites later I should have went for the rice, but it wasn't a huge deal.\\n\\nThe dish itself was exquisite. The lamb was so tender, flavorful, and rich, exactly the way lamb shank should taste. No gaminess, and just the right balance of spices. The cauliflower made for a wonderful accompaniment, the creamy yogurt sauce was seasoned perfectly. The people at my table who had a bite off my plate tried to come back for more so I had to fend them off lol!  \\n\\nWe did go for dessert and ordered Arabic coffee and Kenafeh (which btw takes about 15 to prepare to if you're short on time could be something to consider!) My friends both obsessed over the Kenafeh but honestly I thought it was pretty dry and uninteresting and would probably go with a different desert next time but that is just me! The coffee on the other hand was delicious.\\n\\nOverall I was a happy camper. This place is not cheap but makes up for it in quality. There is something here for everyone :)\", u'Pretty cool ambience (esp around the long table facing the bar). They have good appetizers like most other Mediterranean place but what makes the difference is their entree. They have such big portions of entrees that you will be stuffed. They also have no meat-no eggs entree which is delicious as well.', u\"Food here is pretty good. Service is not good when it is busy.\\n\\nWe had beriani dejaj and lamb bamei. The beriani dejaj is so creamy and good. I wish I had that instead of the lamb bamei I got. Its only because I don't like lamb.\", u\"We found this place on Yelp due to the high reviews. Over 2000 reviews and 4.5 stars is very credible and seemed like a no brainer for us on our first night up in the Bay Area.  We had the gambari and falafels for appetizer which I both recommend. For dinner we had the sambusak, which was really tasty. I love the Mediterranean flavored as they are unique compared to other cuisines. The restaurant seemed like easily the best option on a cool Murphy street. They were packed as expected so be prepared to wait or come at a less busy time. The servers did a great job at fitting is in quickly and even moved us from a two to four person table when my cousin decided to come. I wish we had a restaurant like this in the San Diego area. The high reviews don't lie and you shouldn't be let down.\", u'6/11/15: Came here for lunch today and was impressed!  It was a little confusing cause there\\'s a popular chain called \"Dish n Dash\" which apparently is not the same thing.  But, after looking them up, I guess it\\'s all owned by the same folks, and the \"n\" version is kinda their fast-foodish offshoot.  I\\'ve been to Dish n Dash too, and it tastes good, but prices were almost offensively high.  Here prices are still a little expensive but the food is fancier and it\\'s a nice restaurant so I think it\\'s more justified.\\n\\n1. Pineapple-coconut juice $3.5: Very nice drink.  Syrupy with good coconut flavor.  I\\'m not the hugest fan of coconut, but it\\'s very well balanced in this drink.  Kinda wish I could taste more pineapple, but I dunno, maybe it wouldn\\'t be as good.  Decent price for the quality.  7/10.\\n\\n2. Mansaf $16.95: The dish they serve it on is large and the pile of rice and stewed lamb is served on a bed of creamy yellow sauce that fills the entire plate.  I would say the rice and lamb fills about a medium-sized bowl.  Love the sauce--can\\'t really place the dominant flavor, but it\\'s really rich and yummy.  Rice is good.  The lamb is very tender and has a good amount of fat, making it taste pretty good.  Might be a tad expensive for what you get, but heck, it tastes really good.  9/10.\\n\\nI\\'d love to come back.  Never had anything like that mansaf before.  I dunno if I just never went to any good middle eastern places, but so far this place is the best I\\'ve tried based on my limited selection of stuff.\\n\\nOne thing to note: our service was horrible.  After serving us the food outside I couldn\\'t find a server anymore to ask for water.  People were nice enough, but it\\'s just that there were no waiters to be found.\\n\\nFor now... 5/5.\\n\\n#middleeastern #mediterranean', u\"Vegetarians and omnivores alike will delight in this restaurant.  We had a vegetarian among our party of four last night at DishDash and he really enjoyed having so many dishes to choose from for dinner!\\n\\nWe started with the Maza Platter for 4. I often find baba ganoush and hummus pretty bland in most Middle Eastern restaurants, but the hummus and baba ganoush here were very tasty. Seasoning was perfect and they were wonderful slathered on pita bread.  I especially liked the Rihan app. It has grilled eggplant, tomatoes, basil and fresh feta. So delicious. If you're an eggplant lover like me, you will love this app.  I didn't eat as much of the pita bread as my husband as I wanted to have room and enjoy my main entree!\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered the same thing--the Mansaf. I ordered a Kebab dish the first time we ate here a few years ago. I'm so glad I ordered the Mansaf this time. Delicious!!!! I loved how flavorful the dish was. The lamb was tender, the rice and yogurt sauce were tasty and loved the crunch from the slivered almonds. The hubby ordered and loved Lamb Shank dish with tomatoes and onions. I tasted his lamb and it was very good too. I think my dish was better though. :). My friend's husband ordered the falafel dish with tomatoes and onions, and it must have been good 'cause he wiped it clean.\\n\\nWe did not have dessert unfortunately. We had no room in our tummies. For beverages, I had the lemonade with mint. It was a little too sweet for me, so I added some water to tone down the sweetness. My friend had a pineapple juice mix and she really like it too.\\n\\nWe'll have to come back here. The food was fabulous. Service was great and the ambience was nice. This is an extremely popular restaurant, so make a reservation! They had heat lamps outside so you can eat alfresco even at night. They also accommodate big groups.\", u'Oh Dish Dash, I finally got to try you and you let me down in multiple ways\\n\\n4 of us went to Dish Dash we had reservations thank God, I heard this place was smallish and always busy and in fact to busy. The host took us to a table inside and disappeared. We looked over our menu\\'s and he came back asking about drinks, so ice tea and water appeared on our table and a small basket of Peta bread and a dipping plate. The bread was gone in about 2 mins... Yes we have 4 people at the table not 2, bring us a bigger thing of bread !! So as we wait for someone to take our order, and then wait, and then wait even more the waiter comes by and we asked 3 different people for more bread !!  Only the bus boy came through for us... Now we order some Hummus and dinner and wait.\\n\\nThe Hummus appears, but no bread, we are out, please bring us more bread !! 5 mins later more bread appears and we have to ask, can we get more water and so on you get the idea, so I will cut this short, the thing that pissed me off the most was at the end of the dinner, when they pick up your plates pretty fast, I am guessing to get you out the door to get the next round of people in, a lady comes to our table and asks us would you like to see the desert menu?  I look and her and say \" Yes Please, it\\'s her B Day \" and she smiles at me only to never be seen again ( WTH ) and no menu, 5 to 10 mins later our waiter comes by and asks if we want to see the desert menu.. OMG Epic Fail..... Bad Bad Bad Dish Dash...\\n\\nPRO:\\nFood is good and lots of choices\\n\\nCON:\\nWay to busy..\\nWay to over booked..\\nBread basket is the same for single or 4 / 6 people\\nStaff is way to over worked or just fails at remembering what you asked for...\\nWait for almost everything just ended up making us ask, was it really worth coming to a place like this, since we were ready to bail out the door a few times and just hit Kabuls a few blocks down!!\\nTends to rune birthday moments ( thank you so much for that ) !!! So please don\\'t bring anyone here for special event', u\"JIZZ IN YOUR PANTS GOOD. No kidding.\\n\\nOrder the Mansaf!\\n\\nI had a special moment with one of the lamb dishes that I haven't encountered before at this restaurant. It seems like everyone in the South bay and their mom have been here at least once, since its known as one of the finest restaurants to visit in the Sunnyvale area.\\n\\nRESERVATION SITUATION\\nDecided to have dinner here after 8:30 pm (they close at 9:30) on a Thursday, without reservations, with my mom. When we arrived, the place was swarming with patrons. In spite of the seemingly packed venue, my mom and I were seated at a table in approx. 15 minutes. We were fortunate at that moment, but I highly recommend that you make reservations at least a day or two in advance, as this restaurant has become increasingly popular over the years.\\n\\nFEELING ADVENTUROUS\\nIn the past, I had always resorted to ordering their savory kabob dishes, but when I visited for dinner during this particular evening, I was feeling some of that 'Yelper boldness', so I decided to ask our server for his entr\\xe9e recommendation. With no hesitation, he eagerly advised me to order the Mansaf and I went for it. All entrees come with your choice of Freekeh, or basmati rice topped with sliced, toasted almonds.\\n\\nENTREES & DESSERT\\n+ MANSAF $18.95: Mmm, my palate felt pampered by the silky melody of exceptionally delicate lamb, slow-cooked in aged yogurt, with almond-topped basmati rice. Friggen brilliant. Rice was perfectly cooked and the yogurt was super flavorful. My only gripe was that the small chunks of lamb were extremely tender, rapidly melting in my mouth, so the meat's flavor quickly got lost in the rich, abundant yogurt sauce. I only wish that the lamb flavor was a little more outstanding, or perhaps I wish the chunks of lamb were larger. Don't fret---there really IS lamb in the dish. The small chunks of lamb are HIDDEN inside the dome of basmati rice! 0.o More lamb flavor though, please Dish Dash. :/\\n\\n+ MASHWI $24.95: SHIEET, I didn't have the chance to mooch off my mom's dish, because she immediately scarfed it down, so she was obviously impressed by her order (Marinated, grilled sea bass, prawns, and seasonal vegetables).\\n\\nWe ended the night with the 'Cho-kolata' lava cake with ice cream $8.00, which we don't particularly recommend. I'm a total dessert fiend, but the elementary ingredients were anything but unique. I could've purchased a cheap tub of ice cream and pre-packaged lava cake from Safeway and my rendition of this Cho-kolata dessert would be just as mediocre.\\n\\nDRINK RECOMMENDATIONS\\nTheir drink menu, especially their wine list, is pretty extensive. Per our server's recommendation, I ordered the Zanzabeel (ginger, apple juice, mint, ginger beer, Michter's Sour Mash Whiskey). All cocktails are $10.00. If you enjoy ginger and mint, then you'll appreciate this drink. My mom ordered the Terre Rouge Syrah $11.00. We thoroughly savored our drinks. They also serve draft and bottled beer and single malt scotch.\\n\\nVENUE\\nI really, really dig the bustling locale. A 'Cocktail Happy Hour,' chill kind of crowd. It's kinda loud inside, so you may have to shout at your dinner companion. I'm considering adding this restaurant to my 'Make the Panties Drop' list. Although the venue isn't exactly romantic, you could still possibly make her panties drop with the acclaimed 'authenticity' of the dishes here and the wonderful ambiance. Saw some dude at the table next to us caressing a woman's arm and it looked like she was pretty amused. Get it in, bro.\\n\\nSERVICE\\nFriendly service is satisfactory (15% solid tip), but not worth the 18% tip that the restaurant recommends/appreciates. Call me cheap or finicky, but I wasn't charmed.\\n\\nVERDICT\\nOverall, a solid four-star restaurant. I deducted one star merely because the flavors of the dishes here don't surpass the flavors I've encountered with dishes that cost less at other restaurants I've been to. Nevertheless, delicious food. In my opinion, you're essentially paying more $$ here for their 'fresher' ingredients, delightful ambiance, and neater presentation.\\n\\n+ Vegetarian options\\n+ Catering is available\\n+ Street parking and Macy's parking lot\", u'Excellent everything! Perfect service. Delicious food. First time here and I love it. Attentive waiter. Helped us figure out the menu. Good quality food. A bit pricy but worth it. Love the d\\xe9cor.', u\"Probably the best resto in Sunnyvale if not the South Bay. I've tried everything but the lamb (ugh). The fattoush salad is easily shared by 4 people.  The beef and chicken kebabs w/veggies are delicious as is the  Mashwi (grilled seabass & prawns w/veggies.  A bit different is the Shakshuka (prawns in an eggplant and tomato sauce).  Unless you want to wait for hours (or be turned away) make reservations.  Consistently good food and service.\", u\"Honestly, i could even say 4.5. I have been to many Persian restaurants before, and was expecting a nice koobideh, but was very surprised when I opened the menu and saw lots of unknown dishes. I asked the waiter and he recommended the Mansaf - slow cooked lamb over basmati rice covered with aged yogurt - and it was delicious! This dish was incredible - full of spices and flavor, and incredibly unique. I also tried my friends tabsi (another dish i've never tried before) and another uniquely spiced dish. The service here was also very great. I asked for 1/2 rice 1/2 freekah (quinoa type), but he recommended the rice and gave me a small side of freekah to try for free, which I found to be incredibly nice. We also got the kunafah, but I found it to be less sweet than I have had in other places. I will be back here for sure.\", u\"Being Palestinian, it's pretty hard to impress us when eating middle eastern foods. But honestly, everything we ate was on point. You can taste the quality of the food. Very tasty!!!! Oh downfall was the timing between appetizers and main meals. It took a while.\", u\"Best place in the South Bay! Excellent service and great ambience. I love the lamb dishes, especially the Lamb Masaf and the Shih Tahouk.\\nUsually, I start with a vodka martini and continue with a nice Malbec. Don't miss the chocolate lava cake. It's prepared fresh, so it's recommended to order it 15-30 minutes in advance.\", u'Went here last week and the food was great. We had to wait 20-25 mins to get seated.\\n\\nThey used modern tech to alert us via text messages when the seats were available, which was cool. Our server was attentive enough. It was understandable because the restaurant was full at the time. We had to wait quite a long time for a check at the end. The guys who gave food and cleaned up our table were very polite and seemed to be more attentive than our own server, who returned the wrong check afterwards lol. Anyway, understandable.\\n\\nAbout the food, dry but tasty. I had Teka Kebab which was ordered as medium well. They came out perfectly. The beef was great, reasonably seasoned. I like how they made the vege. Nice dressing with broccoli. Coming with the dish was a green and sour sauce. Oh, speaking of sauce, the one they gave us at the start with the bread... it tasted so weird... oily and bland.. but I believed that was made from some kind of ethnic herbs.... anyway, it was strange. maybe it was supposed to taste like that. Not a big fan, but glad that I tried.\\n\\nIn terms of pricing, it was good. I came out full and satisfied so that was good.', u\"I love Mediterranean food, but unfortunately that often means just hummus and falafel- this restaurant offers a wider range of meal options- which are super tasty! They serve bread first with a strange sesame seed dipping sauce, which I thought tasted kind of weird. I ordered the M'shakaleh, which was sooo good and unlike anything I've ever tasted. My friend got the shakshuka, which was different than other shakshuka's I've had, and was just ok. I really like the environment of this restaurant as well- I will be back!\", u'DISHDASH IS HOME TO THE BEST FALAFELS YOU WILL EVER HAVE.\\n\\nFreshly baked, out of the oven. Or are they fried? Whatever.\\nAwesome. (This is my favorite adjective to describe things I like.)\\nLovely. You will fall in love.\\nAngelic. If you go to heaven, you\\'ll be able to eat these forever.\\nFluffy!\\nEdible. Very, very edible.\\nLegitimate. You might think, \"Holy !@#$, I can\\'t believe it\\'s not falafels!\"\\n\\n...but oh yes, it is falafels.\\n\\nP.S. Everything else is good, too!', u\"Oh DishDash. You're my go to for beriani.\\n\\nFOOD - I always get the beriani dajaj (chicken, potatoes, almond slivers, raisins, beans, and aged-yogurt with rice) and it never does me wrong. As for the Sabanech (lamb shank, spinach, beans)... I enjoyed the lamb but was not a fan of the spinach and bean mixture. A bit too drenched.\\n\\nAMBIANCE - It's a nice atmosphere with dimmed lighting. Crowded often, even on random Wednesday nights. However, I don't enjoy how close the tables in the middle are together. You can hear the conversations of the people next to you if you're quiet.\\n\\nOTHER - I love that they text you when your table is ready so you can walk around without a big buzzer, there is complimentary warm pita bread and the great service.\", u\"It's always nice to get out of your comfort zone and try something out of the ordinary. Thank you to my girLs for accompanying me to this spot!!\\n\\nLong Lines outside is a great indication that there's something magical going on inside. This is a tiny location that gets pretty packed quickly so come prepared for a possibLe wait.\\nDishDash offers a vast menu and is guaranteed to satisfy even your pickiest eaters.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\nMaza SampLer for 4\\nBeriani- Beef with aged yogurt sauce\\nMashwi- Seabass + Prawns\\nM'Sakhan- Chicken wrapped in crust w/saffron yogurt\\nCho-KoLata- Choc Lava Cake\\nKenafeh- FiLodough + Cheese dessert\\n\\nFirst off, the complimentary pita and dip is amazeballs. I had to force myself to stop eating it in order to make room for all the food we ordered.\\nMasa Mediterranean SampLer is a must. A smorgasbord of delicious dips to get your tastebuds warmed up.\\nBeriani had chunks of beef cooked with potatoes, almonds, & raisins cooked in a yogurt sauce. Normally I'm not a fan of cooked raisins but I define made an acception with this. Creamy sauce that was not overbearing.\\nPresentation for the M'Sakhan is a jaw dropper. It's like a delicious edible present that you just can't wait to open. Crispy on the outside and moist cooked chicken on the inside.\\nCho-KoLata is your typical Lava cake- Nothing too thrilling. Kenafeh on the other hand is out of this world!! BeautifuL and deLicious with its crispy exterior and cheesy interior that isn't overwhelmingLy sweet.\\n\\nI will most definitely be back to try a few other dishes. Keep up the great work DishDash :)\", u\"I'm always baffled by the crowds at Dish Dash. I have tried going there five times. Each time, the food has not been good; the service has been marginal three of those five times. One time, the food was so salty as to be inedible. Another time, a hot dish arrived at room temperature. At every visit, I've ordered classic dishes that I've had elsewhere. And always DishDash's preparation has been inferior. I have always gone to this restaurant with other people and they've almost always been disappointed in their dinners.\\n\\nPerhaps the large portion sizes are the draw at DishDash? There are so many restaurants on Murphy Street, including a competitor across the street where the food is far better and the service is appropriately attentive.\", u'If you love lamb as I do, the Sabanech is a must have. Slow cooked lamb, spinach, black-eyed beans, onions.  Subtle yet sublime.', u'Let\\'s talk about the best beriani I\\'ve ever had. OK, I rarely eat beriani and I\\'m still confused about whether \"beriani\" is just an alternative name for what we all know as biryani. It doesn\\'t matter because I\\'m not a regular consumer of either. Anyway, DishDash\\'s Beriani Dajaj is simply phenomenal. Actually, all of their dishes are well executed with generous portions and fragrant flavors.\\n\\nWhile the rest of Murphy Street is quiet and ho-hum, you will find bustling crowds waiting outside of DishDash. Make a reservation if you can. If you\\'re not able to, try to swing by during non-primetime hours.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 on a Saturday night but we actually showed up an hour beforehand. Since we didn\\'t hit the dinner rush yet, the hostess was able to accommodate our early arrival. (You can say that we were just REALLY excited to try DishDash...or just terrible with time management.)\\n\\nThe venue is deceptively big and unexpectedly romantic/intimate. We were led to our table in a room near the back. A server plopped down a basket of pita bread and some type of dipping sauce. DON\\'T make the same silly mistake as I did and fill up on the pita bread--as tempting as it is (and they offer free refills).\\n\\nI\\'m a huge fan of Chimay and was pleasantly surprised to find that DishDash carries this beer. First thing we ordered! Priorities.\\n\\nAfter taking some sips, we opted for the following:  \\n\\n*Falafels - crispy blend of organic garbanzo beans with tahini sauce. One of my friends recommended DishDash solely based on their amazing falafels, and they ARE amazing. A crunchy exterior with a moist and grainy center, it can proudly stand as a one-man show on its own, or a harmonious duo with the tahini sauce as well.\\n\\n*Kufta Kebab with Freekah - minced beef and lamb with blended herbs and seasonal vegetables (Brussels sprouts, carrots, tomatoes, onions). Essentially beef and lamb sausages...but to the next level of deliciousness! The dish comes with a zesty green sauce, perfect for dipping the kebabs. The entrees are paired with either Basmati Rice or Freekah; the latter piqued our interest. It\\'s similar to couscous and a lovely base for the kebab.\\n\\n*Beriani Dajaj - thinly sliced chicken breast, potatoes, raisins, and garbanzo beans, served with Basmati rice (or Freekah). The ingredients sit in a massive plate of aged yogurt. Oh man. This yogurt. It is rich, creamy, and so addicting. The raisins add a splendidly sweet twist. You must order this! Fantastic. Like I said, it\\'s the best beriani I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nThe service is prompt, attentive, and friendly. The meals might be a bit spendy but definitely worth it for the quality of food. DishDash is my new South Bay favorite!', u\"I've been here several times and have been soo impressed every time. If you're craving some yummy ethnic food, look no further! DishDash has got you covered ;)\\n\\nI've ordered their sausages, kabobs, and seabass/prawn dishes. Service is quick and everything I've ordered has been delicious.\\n\\nOnly problem I had was last time I went, they gave us a dessert menu but left us stranded for half an hour while we waited for them to take our order. By then we decided to grab the check instead of wait longer.\", u\"I just love this place . Party in my mouth.  I am so lucky to be living close, walking distance to it . Unfortunately it's so crowded all the time and I am not very patient  , not 45 minutes to wait for food . The times I went, I was there right at 5pm to be seated ASAP and right when they open for lunch too .\\nMaybe it's better , it gives me more time for my food to digest before the end of the day.\", u\"DishDash is absolutely delicious and amazing!\\n\\nWe came here on a busy Saturday morning, sat by the street-side and peopled gazed as the weekly farmer's market was going on.(Such a fun way to take it all in and enjoy a sunny Saturday)!\\n\\nAnyway, ambiance aside, we dived into the menu! We started with a humus platter (it was so flavorful and not salty) topped with pickled veggies. Then we ordered the chicken shawarma wrap, Beriani Dajaj (chicken breast cooked in yogurt based sauce) served with rice, and M'shakaleh Vegetarian (beautifully layered vegetables served in yogurt based sauce) over rice. Oh they were all excellent! The yogurt based sauce has great acidity (#topchefreference) but not overwhelming. The portion was generous and just right for three people.\\n\\nIt's been two days since our fabulous lunch at DishDash, and I already wanna go back! Can't wait for the next time!\", u\"I hadn't tried many Mediterranean dishes before trying Dish Dash, and I am very impressed! Since I don't like lamb, I got the Beef Kebab and it was AMAZING. The beef is cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce and fluffy rice make this dish ON POINT. I don't normally like the vegetables that they had but it wasn't bad with the sauce.\\nAlso, my sister got the chicken kebab and it was also cooked perfectly. The chicken was juicy and not dry at all.\\nThe price of the dishes are a little expensive but it will fill you up!  \\n\\nDefinitely give this place a try :)\", u\"My girlfriend was in town visiting and her favorite cuisine happens to be Mediterranean food. After a Yelp search for Mediterranean food sorted by ratings and also some of word of mouth cross-referencing with trusted friends, DishDash was the chosen restaurant for our date on Saturday night. I called ahead to make a reservation because from what I've seen, the place is usually packed.\\n\\nOn the day of, we were running late and I called again 2 hours before our reservation to push it back and the staff was more than accommodating. We ordered a glass of Park Station Pinot Noir and munched on some of the pita bread while deciding what to order. Based on the waiter's recommendation, we went with the beriani dejaj and shish taouk (chicken kebab). I was extremely impressed with the food and the quality of the chicken. The chicken kebab was cooked absolutely perfectly - tender and white on the inside and still blackened and crisp on the outside. It had a great zesty flavor to it which made eating it with the basmati rice and steamed broccoli a satisfying experience. The beriani also had succulent chicken but I really enjoyed the aged yogurt of this dish. It was unique and I am really glad I ordered it because I wasn't too sure what to expect. The topping of raisins/almonds gave the dish a nice crunch as well. The portions are huge so this was more than enough food for us. I took the leftovers home and had it for lunch the next day and it was still just as delicious. I'll be back here again for sure.\", u\"I'm apparently late to the DishDash party.\\n\\nMost of my South Bay friends on yelp had been to DishDash and what a great thing that is! ;-)  I don't even need to do extensive research. (that's a lie, I studied the menu the night before!)\\n\\nThe place feels a bit claustrophobic with the weird set-up: an awkward hostess stand right in front of the entrance, a smallish/narrow dining section right behind the wall and then to the right, it opens to a larger dining room which also houses the bar area.\\nDefinitely make a reservation because even on a Tuesday night, this place was packed.\\n\\nI had the Bamieh which is slow-cooked lamb with grilled okra, tomatoes, onions and garlic. I love the combination of these flavors as they constitute a more hearty, comforting base for the fall-off-the-bone lamb!  I accompanied this with pickled veggies just to cut through the acidity of the dish.  My friends' entrees also tasted good: the Mashwi with the large prawns and the Mo, king of Kebab with tender beef cubes.\\n\\nDowntown Sunnyvale may only be 2 blocks long, but this restaurant scores big in my book. I'm excited for a return visit.\", u'I had the Bamieh, a slow-cooked lamb dish with okra, tomato sauce and onions, very tender and delicious. I savored and finished the soupy sauce before even venturing into the nice size lamb shank on well presented plate. The rice was yummy and perfect with this dish.\\n\\nThis was our second visit to DishDash and we were not disappointed. The ambiance was nice and relaxing, not overly loud or crowded and nice energy. The service was very efficient. We ordered our food fairly quickly and started out with a healthy stack of Pita bread to complement our appetizer, the Maza platter which was really flavorful! I like the  olives and hummus on my pita. Even our vegetarian friend  was happy with the selection of vegetarian food options here.\\n\\nMy wife had the Mansaf, which looked wonderful with the pyramid shape of rice surrounded by the soupy mote of yogurt to cool things down. Next time I will order the Mansaf since I did get to tast it and it was fabulous! We were not rushed and the servers were attentive but not overly so which was perfect. I like the lighting and feel of the place which was cozy and warm.\\n\\nThey have tables outside with heat lamps so next dinner here, we will sit outside and enjoy the night with Mediterranean food at DishDash in Sunnyvale. The prices were fair I thought for the quality of food and experience, overall.', u'Hit this place up for lunch on a Friday and it was super busy. Normally, I dislike crowded places, but it was easy to see the service was top-notch, not-stop hustling to get orders out so we took a chance. It also helped that we opted to sit at the bar to cut down on the wait and got our food within 15-20 minutes.\\n\\nI ordered the beriani with beef (more unique, but pricier, ~$16) based on Yelp reviews and my date got the lamb shwarma with a side of fries (cheaper and good value, ~$12, definitely very hearty). Everything was on point: well-seasoned, large portions, but what really stands out is the meat! Extremely moist and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you like meat tender and juicy, this is a prime spot for grubbing!']"

Although all my friends rave about the swirl , some alcoholic beverage.  I am on weight watchers and I know it\\'s equivalent to my daily points I am allowed .\\nSo no \"swirling\" in the pounds on this body.', u\"One of my favorite restaurants. There is always something new to try or old favorites to fall back on. Everything tastes very fresh and wholesome. I would say that the food tastes homemade, but I don't think that most people can cook this well. There are several lower calorie selections for those who are very careful with their orders. My kids like the food, too. My little one often gets the bean dip or hummus.We often share a chocolaty dessert at the end of the dinner.\\n\\nThe truth is that the swirls are the best things on the menu. They are like a little vacation. The alcohol level is really high. This is no watered down margarita!\", u\"I went to Aqui's for the first time after months of anticipation to try their infamous Swirls. Let me tell you, I was drunkly surprised at how strong yet delicious they are. It's hard to find a really good drink that actually tastes good. I'm not saying you can't taste the different liquors in this drink but it's a good taste. Like a margarita, but a better feeling after its all gone. The food wasn't so great but it wasn't terrible. I got the Serrano Bacon Burrito....minus the bacon & BBQ sauce cause I find BBQ sauce to be strange on a burrito. The Serrano sauce was great with chips & the mild salsa was really good too. I'd go again, but probably not for the food.\", u'We came here because of the 4 star rating... not too many of those in the area.\\n\\nFirst thing I noticed is that the place always seems busy, which is a positive start. I was surprised to find out that it was an \"order-and-sit\" place, where there\\'s really no servers. That doesn\\'t mean the service wasn\\'t there, and in fact the gentleman who took my order was very polite and courteous. I asked for a recommendation and he offered the tamarind-apple fresca, which was light and delicious.\\n\\nThe chipotle chicken special was good, but not great. Not good enough to recommend, but not bad enough to prevent me from coming back.\\n\\nI really enjoyed eating outside in the cool spring sun, so I\\'ll be back to try something else soon.', u'Extremely sweet drinks - even the Industrial Strength Margarita, which I hoped would be neutral, was too sweet.(Plain margaritas are usually fairly bitter and tart. This one was syrupy sugar overload.) Drab interior, good chips and salsa (but who can screw that up? haha), and pretty high prices with no \"happy hour\" to speak of. I just wasn\\'t thrilled.', u\"I love that they have healthy Mexican food.  It's really good!  \\n\\nMy friend suggested we meet up here.  We split a burrito and chips and were full.  \\n\\nIt's really nice that they have tables outside.  We must have sat there for 3 hours chatting away and no one bothered us.  \\n\\nIt was a beautiful afternoon with a good friend!\", u\"Industrial strength margarita ... Enough said.\\n\\nBesides their amazing margaritas, their food is up there on quality too! Their food isn't what you would normally get at a taqueria; it's a little fancier, for the lack of a better word.\\n\\nIf you come here during a workday, just know the place is PACKED starting around 11:45am until around 1:20pm. It doesn't take that long to order food during that time but you will definitely struggle to find a place to sit if you want to dine in. If you come outside of those hours, there usually isn't a line at the counter but if you come during the rush, expect a line of 7-10 people ahead of you. Same goes for parking. Its a small parking lot so it can be difficult to find parking.\\n\\nI normally get the cowboy salad with chicken. The salad is huge! I have a tough time finishing it and usually only get about 2/3 of the way before giving up. Not only are the portions huge but the flavors are delicious. I'm not normally someone who chooses a salad as my entree but here, its another story. Its more like a chicken dish on a large bed of lettuce and you have to eat your way through the lettuce and chicken to get to the tortilla at the bottom.\\n\\nThis used to be a go to spot for lunch but since our department moved about 15 minutes away, I don't get out here as much but it is always worth the drive over.\", u\"Aqui's is one of my favorite local restaurants. Their food in very interesting and always tasty. It makes me step outside the same old routine and try something new without spending the big bucks. The only negative is the loud, cold atmosphere. It not not necessarily comfortable to dine there.\", u\"Basically I'm going to take a risk and say anything and everything you order here will make your stomach and taste buds happy.\\nPersonal favorites:\\n- the mango salad\\n- chicken flautas\\n- any of the wraps\\nBut whatever you do, make sure to try the swirls at least once! One is good enough to hit a regular light drinker like myself!\", u\"It's worth a go for sure. Pretty crowded, but a little patience can get you a seat on the patio. Service is really great and helpful and the food is quite good with lot's of specials, usually. I would prefer bigger portions.\", u\"I go to drink the drinks but had kids with me this time.\\n\\nThe kid menu leaves a lot to be desired. You can see there wasn't much thought put into much but the name for the dishes.\\n\\nThe place is great and I'll go back regardless.\", u'Saturday night here - wonderful! The line between 7:30 & 8:00 only 2-4 people (unlike Willow Glen which has 10-20 on line for like times).\\n\\nFood Outstanding.\\n\\nSome order takers (Chris) 5  Stars, some (don\\'t know nor want to know her name) 1 Star she starts to take our order then walks away abruptly from the register to have Chris take over without explanation.\\n\\nSome bus help (Caucasian girl) 1 Star who asks us \"Are there any dishes that I can take?\" when in reality they have food in them and are in front of us two separate times during our dinner, some (African American guy) 5 Stars - he asks us after our plates are empty of food and pushed to the side of the table \"Are you done with these plates?\" very professional and huge genuine smile on his face.\\n\\nWater dispenser has water dripping from multiple places in the machine.', u\"In town for a quick concert and was in search of some bomb Cali mex without eating Taco Bell or chipotle. Dads annoying and gluten free, and surprisingly this place has a lot of gluten free option. Heck my vegan cousin was also able to easily indulge with a corn/veggie burrito. Them industrial strength swirls are no joke. When they suggest a two drink max, they ain't jokin. I was nearly on the floor- slight combination of food coma goodness and tequila lol. Only complaint is that getting a table is a tad difficile.\", u'$9 swirls are killer deals! If anything, come to get some healthy-esque dinner and then get bombed on these tequila laden margarita flavored slurpees. 2 of them get me a good buzz.\\n\\nLove the free sala and chips. Although you pay for it once, its unlimited refills. The pico de gallo is fresh and addicting.\\n\\nThe meals are all very \"NorCal\" as my SoCal husband likes to describe the aim at healthy and local food to table concept. They all have great flavors and options. Can probably find an option for everybody.\\n\\nYou do wait in line to order, grab a buzzer and then sit down. During rush hours, it can be hard to find a table. If you need a refill of chips, the bar staff can also refill for you.', u\"I absolutely love LOVE this place!\\n\\nIt's definitely my to-go spot if I want a nice little buzz after work during the week or for a sports game on the weekend. They have a cute, little outside patio area which I love to take advantage of during the summer. It's the perfect place to catch up with your girl friends or to have a casual, date night with your boyfriend. Since it's usually really packed outside, so make sure you pick a time when it's not too busy (try avoiding the weekdays after 7:30pm during the summer)! If you're always starving after work, like me, take note that the food comes out pretty quickly and that their industrial swirls are hands-down one of my favorite drinks. You can barely taste the alcohol, but they still manage to make you feel both amazing and terrible simultaneously. I can never decide between the two.\\n\\nNot only do I love their drinks, but I also love their dishes. They're on the healthier side, so it makes me feel a little bit better about drinking their swirls, and they're only $9-15 per plate! For the atmosphere and taste, I think that cuts a pretty good deal. Lastly, I can't forget to mention the salsa bar, which means a large selection of sauces to try and at an uncapped amount!\\n\\nNow go try this place out!\", u\"Food: Fresh, good, large portions, nice lunch specials, very fair prices.\\nIn love the vegetarian burritos.\\nAwesome spicy sauce.\\n\\nPlace is clean, service is fast. What's more to say?\", u\"My first negative review .. I wanted Mexican for dinner.. I wish I had picked a taco truck ;$ the only good thing about my dining experience here is the slight buzz I got from the sangria ..  Food portions are small..\\nFood was not hot, it was close to cold when we brought it to our table.\\nWe had to walk around to find a table to sit at. Finding a table wasn't a problem but finding a clean one was. Almost all the vacant tables were soiled, and had plates and glasses on them.\\nAs far as food goes, my burrito was okay(not great).. His Salmon was not.\\nMy last ray of hope was the Flourless Chocolate cake.. I was highly disappointed. It was too sweet for me :( and I didn't really enjoy the sauce it came with.\\nOverall! Not impressed! Not coming back.\", u\"Very impressed with this spot. Kind of like the Mexican version of Sonoma Chicken Coop. You pay and then pick up ur own food from the counter - don't have to worry about tip. However the quality of the food is excellent plus their emphasis on sustainable and organic products makes it a huge plus for me.\\n\\nHad lunch there on a Sunday afternoon and the ambience was very pleasant and all the food tasted great. We had burritos, enchiladas, and even our son's kids quesadilla was enjoyable.\\n\\nIn summary, great food quality, good ambience, great prices. Highly recommend it\", u\"I love Aqui's! The swirls are amazing and terrible all at once. You think they're tasty and you want to have some more but by the time you stand up...\\n\\nThe salmon meal under small bites is probably the most delicious thing I've had here. I had a veggie burrito here once and remember thinking it was missing something. That's my reason for taking a star away.\\n\\nHighly recommend this place for a small bite and a swirl!\", u\"We came here completely based on Yelp! reviews.  At first glance, looks can be deceiving.  We were expecting a sit-down restaurant and instead found a line nearly out the door to order (think casual-dining like Chipotle but with a bar and extensive menu offering).  We contemplated turning around but decided to give it a try.  SO glad we did!!!\\n\\nNot only did the line go fast, the orders come out fast, and the personnel seem very friendly, but the food was SO good!  Very fresh ingredients and the most original menu items I'd seen in quite some time.  \\n\\nWe ordered the trio of dips as a starter. Hummus with hot sauce- hello amazing who knew hot sauce on hummus would be so good?! Avocado dip- think big chunks of avocado mounded atop fresh salsa. And a bean dip with a squiggle of sour cream decorating its top.  I wish I had taken a photo, but we couldn't wait to try it and dug right in. Super fresh, perfect balance of flavors, not too spicy but not too tame.  Delicious!\\n\\nAll three of our meals were perfect.  Huge portions and unique platings.  I ordered the California Enchiladas which were served on top of blanched green beans.  Yum!  My friends had fish tacos and fajitas which were also a good balance of flavors.\\n\\nThe hands-down favorite for all three of us though was... you guessed it... the SWIRLS!!  The best tip we received from Yelp! was to try the swirls, and all three of us did.  They were tasty and potent!  I wish we'd have gone for a second round, but I had to drive.  Drats!\\n\\nLooking forward to our next girls weekend in San Jose just so we can come back here for dinner!  Yum!\", u'Lunch here almost every week since I first visited about a month ago. The food is always unfailingly fresh, and seems healthy (okay who am I kidding, chips are NOT healthy but they taste so good!).\\n\\nThe standard menu is pretty good and the daily specials are decent - decent all-rounder for lunch and never gets boring, which is important in a place like Cupertino!\\n\\nFaves: Chips & Guacamole, Adobo Thai Peanut Chicken (Small Plates)\\n\\nService is always good - the wait stuff and busboys are lovely!', u'Came here as I was looking for a light dinner and had heard that this place offered healthy Cal-Mex meals for cheap.\\n\\nHad the Thai Chicken Burrito ($6.99) which lacked any sort of flavor and tasted generally dry - probably wasn\\'t the best idea to get something with \"Thai\" in it at a Mexican restaurant. It was served with a side of tortilla chips which weren\\'t that great either. I also ordered a side of their Tomatillo Soup ($3.99); it was good and it definitely hits the spot if you want something spicy and warm.\\n\\nI did love how clean and spacious the interior felt; definitely more of an upscale place. Sadly, the food just didn\\'t appeal to me.', u\"I used to dislike Aqui because I thought it was bland but now I really appreciate this place. Aqui does a great job of incorporating vegetables into the dish without making it look unbearable. They'll toss in a couple broccolis into the enchilada dish which complements it well.\\n\\nThey also have a variety of vegetarian dishes which look and taste great. It's a great go to place for me and my coworkers. I look forward to coming back! Want to try their swirls one day :)\", u\"Aqui Cal-Mex is a great find in the Cupertino area! It's a heavily-frequented spot by many of my fellow Apple colleagues, and for good reason.\\n\\nI've been to this location of Aqui Cal-Mex about 4 times now over the past 8-9 months, and it's always on our list of places to go when we are deciding where to have lunch during our breaks. We love coming here, because the food is excellent, the restaurant is beautifully designed, there is plenty of seating, and the service is always friendly and accommodating. I've tried a number of dishes at Aqui and here are my top recommendations:\\n\\n1) First of all, always look at what their daily specials are. Today, I had the shrimp enchiladas ($10.99) and they were great. Served on top of jasmine rice with a sweet mango sauce and red and green bell peppers over the enchiladas, this was a surprisingly refreshing and light dish.\\n\\n2) I also really like the crab cake salad. For $8.29, there is always a generous portion of organic spinach, mango chunks, and a great chipotle dressing. Love this salad there!\\n\\n3) Guacmole is excellent - they mix it with pico de gallo and serve it with a generous portion of chips!\\n\\n4) Happy hour is excellent too - appetizers are great, and the drinks are discounted. A great after work spot to hang out with some friends, maybe watch a game or two, and just kick back and relax.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back to have another meal or happy hour at this location. We just had lunch there today for a colleague's going away party and it was terrific. Will be trying the other dishes next time, as well.\", u\"Okay. So I've been here plenty of times now and this place is consistent with their good and drinks.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nMy friends and I have been coming here for over a year and usually on Sundays just to have their swirls. Their swirls are an alcoholic beverage made with their margarine mix and juice. Its a really good tasting adult like slushy. But he careful when drinking them because they are strong. They limit you to 3 a person and I have never really made it even that far. Very good though. Highly suggest the following swirls.\\nPOG- passion orange guava juice with the margarita base\\nAnd the paradise patron swirl.\\n\\nFood:\\nI've ordered their food a couple of times and it's usually really good. All organic and pretty healthy tex mex food.\\nWe frequently get their chips and salsa. Sometimes their guacamole which is really good. And their chips are warm which is way addicting! I can't resist warm chips :p\\n\\nTheir bar tenders are always a pleasure to talk to. Friendly staff and attentive, bus boys  frequently come by to grab dirty dishes from the table.  \\n\\nKinda loud place but it's expected. Good Food at a decent price.\\n\\nOverall good/chill spot. Just don't get drunk. Drink responsibly and always have a DD!\", u\"Compared to the aqui in Downtown Campbell, this one takes the cake! Way less busy and much nicer bind. The patio here is on point! Heaters above most tables (beware, you don't wanna crank those babies up cause they get hotttttt!), relaxing fountain out front, and just a better atmosphere overall. As much as I love grabbing a swirl at the Campbell location before going out--this place is definitely my top pick for grabbing a drink or meal with friends on a weeknight.\\n\\nI highly recommend getting the swirl special over the standard patron paradise.\\n\\nStaff is friendly and prompt, keep up the good work!\", u'Must try crab cakes! Whether it is salad, wrap or main dish. One glass of swirls get you serious swirly. Hehe', u\"Excellent Menu | Friendly | Tasty\\n$ - $$\\n\\nI met up with one of my close friends who lives in Sunnyvale and we ate here. This was my first time eating here and I ordered the Adobo Chicken and I think my friend had the chicken taquitos with sour cream, rice and beans.\\n\\nMy adobo chicken came with some greens and the adobo chicken had a little kick to it because of the aioli sauce, but it was delicious. ($8)\\n\\nIndoor and outdoor seating. Great area. I'd love to see this restaurant chain up where I am in Santa Rosa.\", u\"I really like this place.\\n\\nAqui offers good quality, fresh, healthy, and tasty dishes at large portions and very reasonable prices. It's a casual joint where you can study (WiFi and big tables!) or get your grub/drink on. My friend and I loved the Avocado Dip (chunky guac surrounded by salsa), Mango Walnut Salad (tons of apple, mango, and cranberries), and Chicken Adobo Fajita (a tad spicy and great flavor). We thought it was interesting that the fajita only comes with 1 burrito size tortilla, instead of multiple smaller ones.\\n\\nThe staff also seem happy working here and they're very nice and attentive :).\\n\\nFYI: You seat yourself, order at the front, and pick up your food when your buzzer goes off.\", u\"I've been to this location and the one in Campbell several times, but love that this location is less crowded for obvious reasons. They are known for their swirls and from the menu I usually order the flautas (made with potato and cheese) My bf likes their salmon salad. Usually don't come here for food, but when I do these would be the go to options along with guacamole and chips. They make a good mojito too!\", u\"Swirls, get the job done.\\n\\nHonestly, I've only had Aqui's food once but lately haven't had the chance to try it since I've been caught up getting Swirled.\\n\\nMy favorite swirl is the Sangria Swirl, being a wine lover - but not so fond of tequila kinda gal, this drink fits the bill. The ladies at the bar do a fine job of making them, not too much slush and magical drunkifying liquid so it's well balanced. These drinks are strong (really strong) and no joke, so drink responsibly and enjoy whatever sports they'e playing on the screen.\\n\\nDefinitely will have to grab something to munch on the next time I come here, the food always looks amazing and the crowd is very lively and friendly.\\n\\nNothing is better than Thursday night Swirls and Draft day!\", u'Watch out for the industrial strength margaritas.  They will sneak up on you and knock you out.\\n\\nHowever, the food is really good -- very fresh and unique flavors.  Love the salsa bar, the habanero and mango is the best.  And the outdoor seating is always great during the spring/summer.  They have heaters for the winter time, too.', u\"Aqui isn't your typical restaurant for one because the service is self-service (I've only seen this type of service elsewhere at sonoma chicken). You place your order, get a coaster call/pager, and pick up your food after the coaster call starts flickering. It's a win for the patron because you don't have to pay any tips.\\n\\nAnother win is  the complimentary salsa bar selection and I always go for the ghost chile salsa and the roasted salsa (ground tomato, black pepper?). However, I don't like the red salsa because it is too sweet and the mango salsa is pretty good but unassumingly spicy.\\n\\nTip:\\nWhen I come here with a party of 3+, we usually get a side of chips and hummus for $5 or chips and pico de gallo for $3, since the chips are bottomless.\\n\\nAlso, always keep a lookout for their specials. They always seem to have some type of  wrap with soup and this special is less than all their main menu times.\\n\\nIn general, the food presentation is always surprisingly colorful and they always somehow incorporate surprising flavors into their wraps. Would you ever put apples or mangos into your wrap? If no, think again, you will be surprised about how unique this flavor is. It just makes the wrap taste fresh, wholesome, and crunchy.\\n\\nSit in the outside seating area on a sunny day. It's relaxing to eat out with fresh air and listen to the hustle and bustle of suburbia car traffic.\\n\\nWarnings:\\n\\nThe only dish I have to say to avoid is the tomatillo soup. I was in disbelief when my brother told me it tasted like a salsa, but it really did. Because of this, Aqui should receive a 4.8 but it's close enough to a 5.\", u\"Even though it is an organic restaurant if you are looking for authentic Mexican food this restaurant is not the place. Food is decent but they have a salsa bar where you will find something you like. The only thing that will keep me coming back is their swirls. Their swirls is the best drink they have on the menu, and it will get you messed up. They recommend 2 drinks per person along with a designated driver. So if your looking for a good drink to get you messed up this is the place. But if you are looking for good Mexican food I wouldn't recommend this place.\", u\"After sorta abstaining from alcohol for a while, their margarita was a one-two punch.\\n\\nThere's a note on the menu that they strongly recommend a 2 drink limit per person. I had one and shooooo, that was more than enough :-D Industrial strength indeed!\\n\\nThe fish special that I had was wonderful too.\", u\"Aqui (ah-ki) has fantastic Cal-Mex food.  Not the usual Tex-Mex stuff you see everywhere, instead it's innovative Mexican infused with local seasonal ingredients & AUTHENTIC Latin flavors. This is not Chili's or El Torrito!  \\n\\nThis is not a U.S. version of Mexican food.  Boring, non-adventurous types need not bother coming.\\n\\nThey have a basic, awesome, menu which is complimented with daily & weekly specials. I have never been disappointed with anything I order.  \\n\\nMy favorite entr\\xe9e is the Colorado Angus Beef dinner.  Slow roasted pot roast style beef in a slightly spicy sauce served with their signature slaw which is crunchy, not runny, and a delicious polenta cake!  It's my comfort dish.  The Flourless Chocolate Cake is too die for!\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, and the bar is the best in town. The house specialty drink is their Industrial Strength Margarita, rocks or blended, it packs a punch.  \\nTwo of the bar tenders, Jeanine & Emily, make the best cocktails around.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, casual and comfortable.\\nMy only criticism is because it is so popular, Aqui can be very noisy and crowded. Because the atmosphere is so comfortable there are always families with kids there so if you don't like a popular, friendly, easygoing restaurant where everyone, young & old, likes to hang out, don't go.\", u'The Cupertino location is closer to where I live.  This is my go-to restaurant on most Sunday dinner meal.  I go for all the salads for dinner and they are all excellent.', u'I wasn\\'t too sure I knew what \"Cal-Mex\" was or if I\\'d like it. Was recommended this place by some friends and was a little weary but it was close to where I was.\\n\\nDidn\\'t really know the process, but here it is, go in, look at the menu and daily specials, order at the register, go to the sauce bar and pour yourself some awesome sauces, grab a seat and listen for your number, get your food when called, ENJOY!\\n\\nThe crab cake salad is A MUST HAVE! I really like the chicken taquitos as well. Everything I ate here is well above any expectations, even the sides that come with your entree, rice and beans, are extremely delicious, good enough to be on their own plate but combined with everything else, there is no disputing this place. Every dish they turn out is top notch from beginning to end. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone, I really wish they had a SoCal location, I always crave Aqui when I am away, but I always return if I\\'m in the area.\\n\\nAs a finishing note, their industrial strength margaritas are exactly as the name sounds, make sure you\\'re wearing your hard hat when knocking a few of these down!', u\"I wouldn't say they have the BEST food, but I enjoyed my experience! I usually only come here for the swirls, but this time, we came for the food AND the swirls!\\nThis restaurant is interesting because you order and pay first, then seat yourself.\\n\\nFood: I got the Cuban Pork Enchiladas, and they were okayy. I think I'm just not a huge fan of the corn tortillas in general... so if you like corn tortillas, give this a try! The green beans were really good when dipped in the serrano salsa (from the salsa bar)! The potatoes were okay but not spectacular. I really liked the salsa bar because I am a HUGE fan of salsas and dips in general.  The other dish I tried was the Chicken and Bacon Serrano burrito and it was prettttty good! I used the chunky salsa to dip the chips and it was really good as well.\\n\\nDrinks: STICK TO THE PARADISE SWIRLS! When we come, I always get tempted to try a new or different swirl, but the paradise has been the best tasting so far. The drinks are much stronger than they look, so BE CAREFUL! They even have a notice on their menu to tell you to drink responsibly. These drinks are definitely worth the money (alcohol content wise! ;))\", u\"All the Aqui Cal-Mex places I've been to around the South Bay provide a consistent, enjoyable experience. This place is no exception. I am a big fan of their crab cake salad, which is what I usually get. I also like their sampler dip plate.\\n\\nThe food is excellent, the service is friendly, and the place is spacious. It's a great spot for brunch, lunch, or dinner. This location in particular has easy parking, which is not something that can be said for other Aqui Cal-Mex spots.\\n\\nI'm a fan.\", u'I enjoy this place.  I like variety.

During rush hours, it can be hard to find a table. If you need a refill of chips, the bar staff can also refill for you.', u\"I absolutely love LOVE this place!\\n\\nIt's definitely my to-go spot if I want a nice little buzz after work during the week or for a sports game on the weekend. They have a cute, little outside patio area which I love to take advantage of during the summer. It's the perfect place to catch up with your girl friends or to have a casual, date night with your boyfriend. Since it's usually really packed outside, so make sure you pick a time when it's not too busy (try avoiding the weekdays after 7:30pm during the summer)! If you're always starving after work, like me, take note that the food comes out pretty quickly and that their industrial swirls are hands-down one of my favorite drinks. You can barely taste the alcohol, but they still manage to make you feel both amazing and terrible simultaneously. I can never decide between the two.\\n\\nNot only do I love their drinks, but I also love their dishes. They're on the healthier side, so it makes me feel a little bit better about drinking their swirls, and they're only $9-15 per plate! For the atmosphere and taste, I think that cuts a pretty good deal. Lastly, I can't forget to mention the salsa bar, which means a large selection of sauces to try and at an uncapped amount!\\n\\nNow go try this place out!\", u\"Food: Fresh, good, large portions, nice lunch specials, very fair prices.\\nIn love the vegetarian burritos.\\nAwesome spicy sauce.\\n\\nPlace is clean, service is fast.

Not impressed! Not coming back.\", u\"Very impressed with this spot. Kind of like the Mexican version of Sonoma Chicken Coop. You pay and then pick up ur own food from the counter - don't have to worry about tip. However the quality of the food is excellent plus their emphasis on sustainable and organic products makes it a huge plus for me.\\n\\nHad lunch there on a Sunday afternoon and the ambience was very pleasant and all the food tasted great. We had burritos, enchiladas, and even our son's kids quesadilla was enjoyable.\\n\\nIn summary, great food quality, good ambience, great prices. Highly recommend it\", u\"I love Aqui's! The swirls are amazing and terrible all at once. You think they're tasty and you want to have some more but by the time you stand up...\\n\\nThe salmon meal under small bites is probably the most delicious thing I've had here. I had a veggie burrito here once and remember thinking it was missing something. That's my reason for taking a star away.\\n\\nHighly recommend this place for a small bite and a swirl!\", u\"We came here completely based on Yelp! reviews.  At first glance, looks can be deceiving.  We were expecting a sit-down restaurant and instead found a line nearly out the door to order (think casual-dining like Chipotle but with a bar and extensive menu offering).  We contemplated turning around but decided to give it a try.  SO glad we did!!!\\n\\nNot only did the line go fast, the orders come out fast, and the personnel seem very friendly, but the food was SO good!  Very fresh ingredients and the most original menu items I'd seen in quite some time.  \\n\\nWe ordered the trio of dips as a starter. Hummus with hot sauce- hello amazing who knew hot sauce on hummus would be so good?! Avocado dip- think big chunks of avocado mounded atop fresh salsa. And a bean dip with a squiggle of sour cream decorating its top.  I wish I had taken a photo, but we couldn't wait to try it and dug right in. Super fresh, perfect balance of flavors, not too spicy but not too tame.  Delicious!\\n\\nAll three of our meals were perfect.  Huge portions and unique platings.  I ordered the California Enchiladas which were served on top of blanched green beans.  Yum!  My friends had fish tacos and fajitas which were also a good balance of flavors.\\n\\nThe hands-down favorite for all three of us though was... you guessed it... the SWIRLS!!  The best tip we received from Yelp! was to try the swirls, and all three of us did.  They were tasty and potent!  I wish we'd have gone for a second round, but I had to drive.  Drats!\\n\\nLooking forward to our next girls weekend in San Jose just so we can come back here for dinner!  Yum!\", u'Lunch here almost every week since I first visited about a month ago. The food is always unfailingly fresh, and seems healthy (okay who am I kidding, chips are NOT healthy but they taste so good!).\\n\\nThe standard menu is pretty good and the daily specials are decent - decent all-rounder for lunch and never gets boring, which is important in a place like Cupertino!\\n\\nFaves: Chips & Guacamole, Adobo Thai Peanut Chicken (Small Plates)\\n\\nService is always good - the wait stuff and busboys are lovely!', u'Came here as I was looking for a light dinner and had heard that this place offered healthy Cal-Mex meals for cheap.\\n\\nHad the Thai Chicken Burrito ($6.99) which lacked any sort of flavor and tasted generally dry - probably wasn\\'t the best idea to get something with \"Thai\" in it at a Mexican restaurant. It was served with a side of tortilla chips which weren\\'t that great either. I also ordered a side of their Tomatillo Soup ($3.99); it was good and it definitely hits the spot if you want something spicy and warm.\\n\\nI did love how clean and spacious the interior felt; definitely more of an upscale place. Sadly, the food just didn\\'t appeal to me.', u\"I used to dislike Aqui because I thought it was bland but now I really appreciate this place. Aqui does a great job of incorporating vegetables into the dish without making it look unbearable. They'll toss in a couple broccolis into the enchilada dish which complements it well.\\n\\nThey also have a variety of vegetarian dishes which look and taste great. It's a great go to place for me and my coworkers. I look forward to coming back! Want to try their swirls one day :)\", u\"Aqui Cal-Mex is a great find in the Cupertino area! It's a heavily-frequented spot by many of my fellow Apple colleagues, and for good reason.\\n\\nI've been to this location of Aqui Cal-Mex about 4 times now over the past 8-9 months, and it's always on our list of places to go when we are deciding where to have lunch during our breaks. We love coming here, because the food is excellent, the restaurant is beautifully designed, there is plenty of seating, and the service is always friendly and accommodating. I've tried a number of dishes at Aqui and here are my top recommendations:\\n\\n1) First of all, always look at what their daily specials are. Today, I had the shrimp enchiladas ($10.99) and they were great. Served on top of jasmine rice with a sweet mango sauce and red and green bell peppers over the enchiladas, this was a surprisingly refreshing and light dish.\\n\\n2) I also really like the crab cake salad. For $8.29, there is always a generous portion of organic spinach, mango chunks, and a great chipotle dressing. Love this salad there!\\n\\n3) Guacmole is excellent - they mix it with pico de gallo and serve it with a generous portion of chips!\\n\\n4) Happy hour is excellent too - appetizers are great, and the drinks are discounted. A great after work spot to hang out with some friends, maybe watch a game or two, and just kick back and relax.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back to have another meal or happy hour at this location. We just had lunch there today for a colleague's going away party and it was terrific. Will be trying the other dishes next time, as well.\", u\"Okay. So I've been here plenty of times now and this place is consistent with their good and drinks.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nMy friends and I have been coming here for over a year and usually on Sundays just to have their swirls. Their swirls are an alcoholic beverage made with their margarine mix and juice. Its a really good tasting adult like slushy. But he careful when drinking them because they are strong. They limit you to 3 a person and I have never really made it even that far. Very good though. Highly suggest the following swirls.\\nPOG- passion orange guava juice with the margarita base\\nAnd the paradise patron swirl.\\n\\nFood:\\nI've ordered their food a couple of times and it's usually really good. All organic and pretty healthy tex mex food.\\nWe frequently get their chips and salsa. Sometimes their guacamole which is really good. And their chips are warm which is way addicting! I can't resist warm chips :p\\n\\nTheir bar tenders are always a pleasure to talk to. Friendly staff and attentive, bus boys  frequently come by to grab dirty dishes from the table.  \\n\\nKinda loud place but it's expected. Good Food at a decent price.\\n\\nOverall good/chill spot. Just don't get drunk. Drink responsibly and always have a DD!\", u\"Compared to the aqui in Downtown Campbell, this one takes the cake! Way less busy and much nicer bind. The patio here is on point! Heaters above most tables (beware, you don't wanna crank those babies up cause they get hotttttt!), relaxing fountain out front, and just a better atmosphere overall. As much as I love grabbing a swirl at the Campbell location before going out--this place is definitely my top pick for grabbing a drink or meal with friends on a weeknight.\\n\\nI highly recommend getting the swirl special over the standard patron paradise.\\n\\nStaff is friendly and prompt, keep up the good work!\", u'Must try crab cakes! Whether it is salad, wrap or main dish. One glass of swirls get you serious swirly. Hehe', u\"Excellent Menu | Friendly | Tasty\\n$ - $$\\n\\nI met up with one of my close friends who lives in Sunnyvale and we ate here. This was my first time eating here and I ordered the Adobo Chicken and I think my friend had the chicken taquitos with sour cream, rice and beans.\\n\\nMy adobo chicken came with some greens and the adobo chicken had a little kick to it because of the aioli sauce, but it was delicious. ($8)\\n\\nIndoor and outdoor seating. Great area. I'd love to see this restaurant chain up where I am in Santa Rosa.\", u\"I really like this place.\\n\\nAqui offers good quality, fresh, healthy, and tasty dishes at large portions and very reasonable prices. It's a casual joint where you can study (WiFi and big tables!) or get your grub/drink on. My friend and I loved the Avocado Dip (chunky guac surrounded by salsa), Mango Walnut Salad (tons of apple, mango, and cranberries), and Chicken Adobo Fajita (a tad spicy and great flavor). We thought it was interesting that the fajita only comes with 1 burrito size tortilla, instead of multiple smaller ones.\\n\\nThe staff also seem happy working here and they're very nice and attentive :).\\n\\nFYI: You seat yourself, order at the front, and pick up your food when your buzzer goes off.\", u\"I've been to this location and the one in Campbell several times, but love that this location is less crowded for obvious reasons. They are known for their swirls and from the menu I usually order the flautas (made with potato and cheese) My bf likes their salmon salad. Usually don't come here for food, but when I do these would be the go to options along with guacamole and chips. They make a good mojito too!\", u\"Swirls, get the job done.\\n\\nHonestly, I've only had Aqui's food once but lately haven't had the chance to try it since I've been caught up getting Swirled.\\n\\nMy favorite swirl is the Sangria Swirl, being a wine lover - but not so fond of tequila kinda gal, this drink fits the bill. The ladies at the bar do a fine job of making them, not too much slush and magical drunkifying liquid so it's well balanced. These drinks are strong (really strong) and no joke, so drink responsibly and enjoy whatever sports they'e playing on the screen.\\n\\nDefinitely will have to grab something to munch on the next time I come here, the food always looks amazing and the crowd is very lively and friendly.\\n\\nNothing is better than Thursday night Swirls and Draft day!\", u'Watch out for the industrial strength margaritas.  They will sneak up on you and knock you out.\\n\\nHowever, the food is really good -- very fresh and unique flavors.  Love the salsa bar, the habanero and mango is the best.  And the outdoor seating is always great during the spring/summer.  They have heaters for the winter time, too.', u\"Aqui isn't your typical restaurant for one because the service is self-service (I've only seen this type of service elsewhere at sonoma chicken). You place your order, get a coaster call/pager, and pick up your food after the coaster call starts flickering. It's a win for the patron because you don't have to pay any tips.\\n\\nAnother win is  the complimentary salsa bar selection and I always go for the ghost chile salsa and the roasted salsa (ground tomato, black pepper?). However, I don't like the red salsa because it is too sweet and the mango salsa is pretty good but unassumingly spicy.\\n\\nTip:\\nWhen I come here with a party of 3+, we usually get a side of chips and hummus for $5 or chips and pico de gallo for $3, since the chips are bottomless.\\n\\nAlso, always keep a lookout for their specials. They always seem to have some type of  wrap with soup and this special is less than all their main menu times.\\n\\nIn general, the food presentation is always surprisingly colorful and they always somehow incorporate surprising flavors into their wraps. Would you ever put apples or mangos into your wrap? If no, think again, you will be surprised about how unique this flavor is. It just makes the wrap taste fresh, wholesome, and crunchy.\\n\\nSit in the outside seating area on a sunny day. It's relaxing to eat out with fresh air and listen to the hustle and bustle of suburbia car traffic.\\n\\nWarnings:\\n\\nThe only dish I have to say to avoid is the tomatillo soup. I was in disbelief when my brother told me it tasted like a salsa, but it really did. Because of this, Aqui should receive a 4.8 but it's close enough to a 5.\", u\"Even though it is an organic restaurant if you are looking for authentic Mexican food this restaurant is not the place. Food is decent but they have a salsa bar where you will find something you like. The only thing that will keep me coming back is their swirls. Their swirls is the best drink they have on the menu, and it will get you messed up. They recommend 2 drinks per person along with a designated driver. So if your looking for a good drink to get you messed up this is the place. But if you are looking for good Mexican food I wouldn't recommend this place.\", u\"After sorta abstaining from alcohol for a while, their margarita was a one-two punch.\\n\\nThere's a note on the menu that they strongly recommend a 2 drink limit per person. I had one and shooooo, that was more than enough :-D Industrial strength indeed!\\n\\nThe fish special that I had was wonderful too.\", u\"Aqui (ah-ki) has fantastic Cal-Mex food.  Not the usual Tex-Mex stuff you see everywhere, instead it's innovative Mexican infused with local seasonal ingredients & AUTHENTIC Latin flavors. This is not Chili's or El Torrito!  \\n\\nThis is not a U.S. version of Mexican food.  Boring, non-adventurous types need not bother coming.\\n\\nThey have a basic, awesome, menu which is complimented with daily & weekly specials. I have never been disappointed with anything I order.  \\n\\nMy favorite entr\\xe9e is the Colorado Angus Beef dinner.  Slow roasted pot roast style beef in a slightly spicy sauce served with their signature slaw which is crunchy, not runny, and a delicious polenta cake!  It's my comfort dish.  The Flourless Chocolate Cake is too die for!\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, and the bar is the best in town. The house specialty drink is their Industrial Strength Margarita, rocks or blended, it packs a punch.  \\nTwo of the bar tenders, Jeanine & Emily, make the best cocktails around.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, casual and comfortable.\\nMy only criticism is because it is so popular, Aqui can be very noisy and crowded. Because the atmosphere is so comfortable there are always families with kids there so if you don't like a popular, friendly, easygoing restaurant where everyone, young & old, likes to hang out, don't go.\", u'The Cupertino location is closer to where I live.  This is my go-to restaurant on most Sunday dinner meal.  I go for all the salads for dinner and they are all excellent.', u'I wasn\\'t too sure I knew what \"Cal-Mex\" was or if I\\'d like it. Was recommended this place by some friends and was a little weary but it was close to where I was.\\n\\nDidn\\'t really know the process, but here it is, go in, look at the menu and daily specials, order at the register, go to the sauce bar and pour yourself some awesome sauces, grab a seat and listen for your number, get your food when called, ENJOY!\\n\\nThe crab cake salad is A MUST HAVE! I really like the chicken taquitos as well. Everything I ate here is well above any expectations, even the sides that come with your entree, rice and beans, are extremely delicious, good enough to be on their own plate but combined with everything else, there is no disputing this place. Every dish they turn out is top notch from beginning to end. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone, I really wish they had a SoCal location, I always crave Aqui when I am away, but I always return if I\\'m in the area.\\n\\nAs a finishing note, their industrial strength margaritas are exactly as the name sounds, make sure you\\'re wearing your hard hat when knocking a few of these down!', u\"I wouldn't say they have the BEST food, but I enjoyed my experience! I usually only come here for the swirls, but this time, we came for the food AND the swirls!\\nThis restaurant is interesting because you order and pay first, then seat yourself.\\n\\nFood: I got the Cuban Pork Enchiladas, and they were okayy. I think I'm just not a huge fan of the corn tortillas in general... so if you like corn tortillas, give this a try! The green beans were really good when dipped in the serrano salsa (from the salsa bar)! The potatoes were okay but not spectacular. I really liked the salsa bar because I am a HUGE fan of salsas and dips in general.  The other dish I tried was the Chicken and Bacon Serrano burrito and it was prettttty good! I used the chunky salsa to dip the chips and it was really good as well.\\n\\nDrinks: STICK TO THE PARADISE SWIRLS! When we come, I always get tempted to try a new or different swirl, but the paradise has been the best tasting so far. The drinks are much stronger than they look, so BE CAREFUL! They even have a notice on their menu to tell you to drink responsibly. These drinks are definitely worth the money (alcohol content wise! ;))\", u\"All the Aqui Cal-Mex places I've been to around the South Bay provide a consistent, enjoyable experience. This place is no exception. I am a big fan of their crab cake salad, which is what I usually get. I also like their sampler dip plate.\\n\\nThe food is excellent, the service is friendly, and the place is spacious. It's a great spot for brunch, lunch, or dinner. This location in particular has easy parking, which is not something that can be said for other Aqui Cal-Mex spots.\\n\\nI'm a fan.\", u'I enjoy this place.  I like variety.  You can always rely on the goat cheese quesidilla to taste amazing.  I usually order  the special of the day .\\nI haven\\'t been disappointed ever here .  Although all my friends rave about the swirl , some alcoholic beverage.  I am on weight watchers and I know it\\'s equivalent to my daily points I am allowed .\\nSo no \"swirling\" in the pounds on this body.', u\"One of my favorite restaurants. There is always something new to try or old favorites to fall back on. Everything tastes very fresh and wholesome. I would say that the food tastes homemade, but I don't think that most people can cook this well. There are several lower calorie selections for those who are very careful with their orders. My kids like the food, too. My little one often gets the bean dip or hummus.We often share a chocolaty dessert at the end of the dinner.\\n\\nThe truth is that the swirls are the best things on the menu. They are like a little vacation. The alcohol level is really high. This is no watered down margarita!\", u\"I went to Aqui's for the first time after months of anticipation to try their infamous Swirls. Let me tell you, I was drunkly surprised at how strong yet delicious they are. It's hard to find a really good drink that actually tastes good. I'm not saying you can't taste the different liquors in this drink but it's a good taste. Like a margarita, but a better feeling after its all gone. The food wasn't so great but it wasn't terrible. I got the Serrano Bacon Burrito....minus the bacon & BBQ sauce cause I find BBQ sauce to be strange on a burrito. The Serrano sauce was great with chips & the mild salsa was really good too. I'd go again, but probably not for the food.\", u'We came here because of the 4 star rating... not too many of those in the area.\\n\\nFirst thing I noticed is that the place always seems busy, which is a positive start. I was surprised to find out that it was an \"order-and-sit\" place, where there\\'s really no servers. That doesn\\'t mean the service wasn\\'t there, and in fact the gentleman who took my order was very polite and courteous. I asked for a recommendation and he offered the tamarind-apple fresca, which was light and delicious.\\n\\nThe chipotle chicken special was good, but not great. Not good enough to recommend, but not bad enough to prevent me from coming back.\\n\\nI really enjoyed eating outside in the cool spring sun, so I\\'ll be back to try something else soon.', u'Extremely sweet drinks - even the Industrial Strength Margarita, which I hoped would be neutral, was too sweet.(Plain margaritas are usually fairly bitter and tart. This one was syrupy sugar overload.) Drab interior, good chips and salsa (but who can screw that up? haha), and pretty high prices with no \"happy hour\" to speak of. I just wasn\\'t thrilled.', u\"I love that they have healthy Mexican food.  It's really good!  \\n\\nMy friend suggested we meet up here.  We split a burrito and chips and were full.  \\n\\nIt's really nice that they have tables outside.  We must have sat there for 3 hours chatting away and no one bothered us.  \\n\\nIt was a beautiful afternoon with a good friend!\", u\"Industrial strength margarita ... Enough said.\\n\\nBesides their amazing margaritas, their food is up there on quality too! Their food isn't what you would normally get at a taqueria; it's a little fancier, for the lack of a better word.\\n\\nIf you come here during a workday, just know the place is PACKED starting around 11:45am until around 1:20pm. It doesn't take that long to order food during that time but you will definitely struggle to find a place to sit if you want to dine in. If you come outside of those hours, there usually isn't a line at the counter but if you come during the rush, expect a line of 7-10 people ahead of you. Same goes for parking. Its a small parking lot so it can be difficult to find parking.\\n\\nI normally get the cowboy salad with chicken. The salad is huge! I have a tough time finishing it and usually only get about 2/3 of the way before giving up. Not only are the portions huge but the flavors are delicious. I'm not normally someone who chooses a salad as my entree but here, its another story. Its more like a chicken dish on a large bed of lettuce and you have to eat your way through the lettuce and chicken to get to the tortilla at the bottom.\\n\\nThis used to be a go to spot for lunch but since our department moved about 15 minutes away, I don't get out here as much but it is always worth the drive over.\", u\"Aqui's is one of my favorite local restaurants. Their food in very interesting and always tasty. It makes me step outside the same old routine and try something new without spending the big bucks. The only negative is the loud, cold atmosphere. It not not necessarily comfortable to dine there.\", u\"Basically I'm going to take a risk and say anything and everything you order here will make your stomach and taste buds happy.\\nPersonal favorites:\\n- the mango salad\\n- chicken flautas\\n- any of the wraps\\nBut whatever you do, make sure to try the swirls at least once!

Not impressed! Not coming back.\", u\"Very impressed with this spot. Kind of like the Mexican version of Sonoma Chicken Coop. You pay and then pick up ur own food from the counter - don't have to worry about tip. However the quality of the food is excellent plus their emphasis on sustainable and organic products makes it a huge plus for me.\\n\\nHad lunch there on a Sunday afternoon and the ambience was very pleasant and all the food tasted great. We had burritos, enchiladas, and even our son's kids quesadilla was enjoyable.\\n\\nIn summary, great food quality, good ambience, great prices. Highly recommend it\", u\"I love Aqui's! The swirls are amazing and terrible all at once. You think they're tasty and you want to have some more but by the time you stand up...\\n\\nThe salmon meal under small bites is probably the most delicious thing I've had here. I had a veggie burrito here once and remember thinking it was missing something. That's my reason for taking a star away.\\n\\nHighly recommend this place for a small bite and a swirl!\", u\"We came here completely based on Yelp! reviews.  At first glance, looks can be deceiving.  We were expecting a sit-down restaurant and instead found a line nearly out the door to order (think casual-dining like Chipotle but with a bar and extensive menu offering).  We contemplated turning around but decided to give it a try.  SO glad we did!!!\\n\\nNot only did the line go fast, the orders come out fast, and the personnel seem very friendly, but the food was SO good!  Very fresh ingredients and the most original menu items I'd seen in quite some time.  \\n\\nWe ordered the trio of dips as a starter. Hummus with hot sauce- hello amazing who knew hot sauce on hummus would be so good?! Avocado dip- think big chunks of avocado mounded atop fresh salsa. And a bean dip with a squiggle of sour cream decorating its top.  I wish I had taken a photo, but we couldn't wait to try it and dug right in. Super fresh, perfect balance of flavors, not too spicy but not too tame.  Delicious!\\n\\nAll three of our meals were perfect.  Huge portions and unique platings.  I ordered the California Enchiladas which were served on top of blanched green beans.  Yum!  My friends had fish tacos and fajitas which were also a good balance of flavors.\\n\\nThe hands-down favorite for all three of us though was... you guessed it... the SWIRLS!!  The best tip we received from Yelp! was to try the swirls, and all three of us did.  They were tasty and potent!  I wish we'd have gone for a second round, but I had to drive.  Drats!\\n\\nLooking forward to our next girls weekend in San Jose just so we can come back here for dinner!  Yum!\", u'Lunch here almost every week since I first visited about a month ago. The food is always unfailingly fresh, and seems healthy (okay who am I kidding, chips are NOT healthy but they taste so good!).\\n\\nThe standard menu is pretty good and the daily specials are decent - decent all-rounder for lunch and never gets boring, which is important in a place like Cupertino!\\n\\nFaves: Chips & Guacamole, Adobo Thai Peanut Chicken (Small Plates)\\n\\nService is always good - the wait stuff and busboys are lovely!', u'Came here as I was looking for a light dinner and had heard that this place offered healthy Cal-Mex meals for cheap.\\n\\nHad the Thai Chicken Burrito ($6.99) which lacked any sort of flavor and tasted generally dry - probably wasn\\'t the best idea to get something with \"Thai\" in it at a Mexican restaurant. It was served with a side of tortilla chips which weren\\'t that great either. I also ordered a side of their Tomatillo Soup ($3.99); it was good and it definitely hits the spot if you want something spicy and warm.\\n\\nI did love how clean and spacious the interior felt; definitely more of an upscale place. Sadly, the food just didn\\'t appeal to me.', u\"I used to dislike Aqui because I thought it was bland but now I really appreciate this place. Aqui does a great job of incorporating vegetables into the dish without making it look unbearable. They'll toss in a couple broccolis into the enchilada dish which complements it well.\\n\\nThey also have a variety of vegetarian dishes which look and taste great. It's a great go to place for me and my coworkers. I look forward to coming back! Want to try their swirls one day :)\", u\"Aqui Cal-Mex is a great find in the Cupertino area! It's a heavily-frequented spot by many of my fellow Apple colleagues, and for good reason.\\n\\nI've been to this location of Aqui Cal-Mex about 4 times now over the past 8-9 months, and it's always on our list of places to go when we are deciding where to have lunch during our breaks. We love coming here, because the food is excellent, the restaurant is beautifully designed, there is plenty of seating, and the service is always friendly and accommodating. I've tried a number of dishes at Aqui and here are my top recommendations:\\n\\n1) First of all, always look at what their daily specials are. Today, I had the shrimp enchiladas ($10.99) and they were great. Served on top of jasmine rice with a sweet mango sauce and red and green bell peppers over the enchiladas, this was a surprisingly refreshing and light dish.\\n\\n2) I also really like the crab cake salad. For $8.29, there is always a generous portion of organic spinach, mango chunks, and a great chipotle dressing. Love this salad there!\\n\\n3) Guacmole is excellent - they mix it with pico de gallo and serve it with a generous portion of chips!\\n\\n4) Happy hour is excellent too - appetizers are great, and the drinks are discounted. A great after work spot to hang out with some friends, maybe watch a game or two, and just kick back and relax.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back to have another meal or happy hour at this location. We just had lunch there today for a colleague's going away party and it was terrific. Will be trying the other dishes next time, as well.\", u\"Okay. So I've been here plenty of times now and this place is consistent with their good and drinks.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nMy friends and I have been coming here for over a year and usually on Sundays just to have their swirls. Their swirls are an alcoholic beverage made with their margarine mix and juice. Its a really good tasting adult like slushy. But he careful when drinking them because they are strong. They limit you to 3 a person and I have never really made it even that far. Very good though. Highly suggest the following swirls.\\nPOG- passion orange guava juice with the margarita base\\nAnd the paradise patron swirl.\\n\\nFood:\\nI've ordered their food a couple of times and it's usually really good. All organic and pretty healthy tex mex food.\\nWe frequently get their chips and salsa. Sometimes their guacamole which is really good. And their chips are warm which is way addicting! I can't resist warm chips :p\\n\\nTheir bar tenders are always a pleasure to talk to. Friendly staff and attentive, bus boys  frequently come by to grab dirty dishes from the table.  \\n\\nKinda loud place but it's expected. Good Food at a decent price.\\n\\nOverall good/chill spot. Just don't get drunk. Drink responsibly and always have a DD!\", u\"Compared to the aqui in Downtown Campbell, this one takes the cake! Way less busy and much nicer bind. The patio here is on point! Heaters above most tables (beware, you don't wanna crank those babies up cause they get hotttttt!), relaxing fountain out front, and just a better atmosphere overall. As much as I love grabbing a swirl at the Campbell location before going out--this place is definitely my top pick for grabbing a drink or meal with friends on a weeknight.\\n\\nI highly recommend getting the swirl special over the standard patron paradise.\\n\\nStaff is friendly and prompt, keep up the good work!\", u'Must try crab cakes! Whether it is salad, wrap or main dish. One glass of swirls get you serious swirly. Hehe', u\"Excellent Menu | Friendly | Tasty\\n$ - $$\\n\\nI met up with one of my close friends who lives in Sunnyvale and we ate here. This was my first time eating here and I ordered the Adobo Chicken and I think my friend had the chicken taquitos with sour cream, rice and beans.\\n\\nMy adobo chicken came with some greens and the adobo chicken had a little kick to it because of the aioli sauce, but it was delicious. ($8)\\n\\nIndoor and outdoor seating. Great area. I'd love to see this restaurant chain up where I am in Santa Rosa.\", u\"I really like this place.\\n\\nAqui offers good quality, fresh, healthy, and tasty dishes at large portions and very reasonable prices. It's a casual joint where you can study (WiFi and big tables!) or get your grub/drink on. My friend and I loved the Avocado Dip (chunky guac surrounded by salsa), Mango Walnut Salad (tons of apple, mango, and cranberries), and Chicken Adobo Fajita (a tad spicy and great flavor). We thought it was interesting that the fajita only comes with 1 burrito size tortilla, instead of multiple smaller ones.\\n\\nThe staff also seem happy working here and they're very nice and attentive :).\\n\\nFYI: You seat yourself, order at the front, and pick up your food when your buzzer goes off.\", u\"I've been to this location and the one in Campbell several times, but love that this location is less crowded for obvious reasons. They are known for their swirls and from the menu I usually order the flautas (made with potato and cheese) My bf likes their salmon salad. Usually don't come here for food, but when I do these would be the go to options along with guacamole and chips. They make a good mojito too!\", u\"Swirls, get the job done.\\n\\nHonestly, I've only had Aqui's food once but lately haven't had the chance to try it since I've been caught up getting Swirled.\\n\\nMy favorite swirl is the Sangria Swirl, being a wine lover - but not so fond of tequila kinda gal, this drink fits the bill. The ladies at the bar do a fine job of making them, not too much slush and magical drunkifying liquid so it's well balanced. These drinks are strong (really strong) and no joke, so drink responsibly and enjoy whatever sports they'e playing on the screen.\\n\\nDefinitely will have to grab something to munch on the next time I come here, the food always looks amazing and the crowd is very lively and friendly.\\n\\nNothing is better than Thursday night Swirls and Draft day!\", u'Watch out for the industrial strength margaritas.  They will sneak up on you and knock you out.\\n\\nHowever, the food is really good -- very fresh and unique flavors.  Love the salsa bar, the habanero and mango is the best.  And the outdoor seating is always great during the spring/summer.  They have heaters for the winter time, too.', u\"Aqui isn't your typical restaurant for one because the service is self-service (I've only seen this type of service elsewhere at sonoma chicken). You place your order, get a coaster call/pager, and pick up your food after the coaster call starts flickering. It's a win for the patron because you don't have to pay any tips.\\n\\nAnother win is  the complimentary salsa bar selection and I always go for the ghost chile salsa and the roasted salsa (ground tomato, black pepper?). However, I don't like the red salsa because it is too sweet and the mango salsa is pretty good but unassumingly spicy.\\n\\nTip:\\nWhen I come here with a party of 3+, we usually get a side of chips and hummus for $5 or chips and pico de gallo for $3, since the chips are bottomless.\\n\\nAlso, always keep a lookout for their specials. They always seem to have some type of  wrap with soup and this special is less than all their main menu times.\\n\\nIn general, the food presentation is always surprisingly colorful and they always somehow incorporate surprising flavors into their wraps. Would you ever put apples or mangos into your wrap? If no, think again, you will be surprised about how unique this flavor is. It just makes the wrap taste fresh, wholesome, and crunchy.\\n\\nSit in the outside seating area on a sunny day. It's relaxing to eat out with fresh air and listen to the hustle and bustle of suburbia car traffic.\\n\\nWarnings:\\n\\nThe only dish I have to say to avoid is the tomatillo soup. I was in disbelief when my brother told me it tasted like a salsa, but it really did. Because of this, Aqui should receive a 4.8 but it's close enough to a 5.\", u\"Even though it is an organic restaurant if you are looking for authentic Mexican food this restaurant is not the place. Food is decent but they have a salsa bar where you will find something you like. The only thing that will keep me coming back is their swirls. Their swirls is the best drink they have on the menu, and it will get you messed up. They recommend 2 drinks per person along with a designated driver. So if your looking for a good drink to get you messed up this is the place. But if you are looking for good Mexican food I wouldn't recommend this place.\", u\"After sorta abstaining from alcohol for a while, their margarita was a one-two punch.\\n\\nThere's a note on the menu that they strongly recommend a 2 drink limit per person. I had one and shooooo, that was more than enough :-D Industrial strength indeed!\\n\\nThe fish special that I had was wonderful too.\", u\"Aqui (ah-ki) has fantastic Cal-Mex food.  Not the usual Tex-Mex stuff you see everywhere, instead it's innovative Mexican infused with local seasonal ingredients & AUTHENTIC Latin flavors. This is not Chili's or El Torrito!  \\n\\nThis is not a U.S. version of Mexican food.  Boring, non-adventurous types need not bother coming.\\n\\nThey have a basic, awesome, menu which is complimented with daily & weekly specials. I have never been disappointed with anything I order.  \\n\\nMy favorite entr\\xe9e is the Colorado Angus Beef dinner.  Slow roasted pot roast style beef in a slightly spicy sauce served with their signature slaw which is crunchy, not runny, and a delicious polenta cake!  It's my comfort dish.  The Flourless Chocolate Cake is too die for!\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, and the bar is the best in town. The house specialty drink is their Industrial Strength Margarita, rocks or blended, it packs a punch.  \\nTwo of the bar tenders, Jeanine & Emily, make the best cocktails around.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, casual and comfortable.\\nMy only criticism is because it is so popular, Aqui can be very noisy and crowded. Because the atmosphere is so comfortable there are always families with kids there so if you don't like a popular, friendly, easygoing restaurant where everyone, young & old, likes to hang out, don't go.\", u'The Cupertino location is closer to where I live.  This is my go-to restaurant on most Sunday dinner meal.  I go for all the salads for dinner and they are all excellent.', u'I wasn\\'t too sure I knew what \"Cal-Mex\" was or if I\\'d like it. Was recommended this place by some friends and was a little weary but it was close to where I was.\\n\\nDidn\\'t really know the process, but here it is, go in, look at the menu and daily specials, order at the register, go to the sauce bar and pour yourself some awesome sauces, grab a seat and listen for your number, get your food when called, ENJOY!\\n\\nThe crab cake salad is A MUST HAVE! I really like the chicken taquitos as well. Everything I ate here is well above any expectations, even the sides that come with your entree, rice and beans, are extremely delicious, good enough to be on their own plate but combined with everything else, there is no disputing this place. Every dish they turn out is top notch from beginning to end. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone, I really wish they had a SoCal location, I always crave Aqui when I am away, but I always return if I\\'m in the area.\\n\\nAs a finishing note, their industrial strength margaritas are exactly as the name sounds, make sure you\\'re wearing your hard hat when knocking a few of these down!']"

    "FIELD1":"Sushi Tomi",
    "FIELD2":1449,
    "FIELD3":4,
    "FIELD4":"[u\"This is a solid and authentic japanese restaurant nestled in mountain view. I don't think too highly of the South Bay in regards to sushi but sushi tomi really surprised me.\\n\\nThings to know:\\n- Arrive upon opening time to avoid waiting in line otherwise come with patience as the lines can get long\\n- Chirashi is really good. I love their rice.. It is some of the best in my opinion\\n- Tomi special roll is an absolute must\", u\"The hype brought me here. I've walked past this restaurant many times and didn't think much of it. It's very unassuming, whole in the wall type. However, considering all the positive reviews we gave it a try.\\n\\nWord is the wait can get quite long, but we came at 815PM on a Sunday evening so it was only ~15 minutes. I ordered the Extra Special Nigiri dinner and my boyfriend ordered the Combination Special: Salmon Teriyaki and Chicken Sukiyaki.\\n\\nHis sukiyaki was good, homestyle-like; nothing fancy and prepared in the kitchen vs at our table. As part of a combination dinner, that's to be expected though. The other dishes were just ok. Boyfriend said salmon was semi-dry and my nigiri was meh. They were out of Sake which wasn't the end of the world so they substituted Hamachi per my request instead. I also got schooled by ordering the Extra Special, but didn't get Toro. Didn't realize until was too late.\\n\\nBottom line: the food fell flat.\", u'I was able to get a table here after an hour or so wait. Sushi Tomi seems to be a more traditional sushi place that focuses more on basic sashimi and rolls instead of the more complex rolls seen at other sushi places.\\n\\nWe ordered the extra special sashimi plate and the regular chirashi bowl. In addition to staples like salmon and regular tuna, the extra special plate has sea snail, uni, ebi, toro, and amberjack. The regular chirashi bowl had more of the standard lineup of fish, but I imagine getting the extra special chirashi would be similar to the extra special sashimi plate.\\n\\nOverall, the fish was very fresh but the 1 hr+ waits (no option for reservation) and the slightly higher price point is something to consider. The wealth of sushi places in the area makes me feel like I could find another place with a shorter wait and lower price even if it is slightly worse in quality. Sushi Tomi is undoubtedly a quality sushi restaurant though and worth a try if you are willing to wait.', u\"The wait is crazy here FYI, but I would say it was worth it! :)\\n\\nChef's Choice Sashimi\\n--The lean tuna and salmon cuts tasted very fresh and the texture was great! I tried Amber Jack for the first time and although it had too strong of a fishy taste, I enjoyed the moderately fatty texture. The toro wasn't my cup of tea but it was fresh nonetheless. I did not like the taste of the Uni and probably will never eat that again (once again my preference and not the way it was prepared). I had the hardest time eating the sea snails because it reminds me of the times I killed snails in my backyard. Anyhow, I like the texture more than the taste or the thought of eating snails. The white fish's texture was in between a crunchy and jelly consistency, which I didn't quite like. The flavor of the fish I didn't particularly enjoy either. I thought overall I experienced a lot of raw seafood and also got to eat fresh, delicious standard cuts like tuna and salmon.\\n\\nExtra Special Chirashi\\n-This had some of the standard sashimi cuts including tuna and salmon. The seaweed and mushrooms on the side were a great addition! The egg was a bit too sweet! The rice was chewy and not too sticky. Yay!\\n\\nI am giving this place a four star because the seafood is very fresh. I would love to come back to try some of the fun appetizers though!\", u\"MMMMMMM!!! SASHIMI LUNCH! SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK!\\n\\nJust writing this is making my mouth water so let's get to it before I ruin my keyboard.\\n\\nAmbiance:  This place is decent sized for Castro but because it's so yummy there will always be a wait at lunch.  Cool and casual, there is nothing to complain about (unless they can expand the place!)\\n\\nService: My service was good even though the place was slammed.  I'm sure they're used to that level of traffic by now.\\n\\nFood: SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK! I ordered the sashimi lunch under recommendation of my waitress and boy am I glad I did!.  They were served at a perfect temperature and I was given a fairly large portion considering the cost of the lunch deal.  The star of the meal was the SALMON! The cut was so fatty the fish had an almost smoky flavor to it even though it was raw.  I can still taste it in my mouth just thinking about it.  I eat a lot of sushi and I've never had salmon so flavorful.  *shudders*\\n\\nWhat else can I say.  Will be back.  Will get salmon again.  Long wait, don't care.\", u\"This place is now my favorite sushi restaurant!\\n\\nEverything we ordered yesterday was delicious!  Simple, yet fresh!\\n\\nSashimi dinner all just melted in the mouth and the fresh oysters were prepared perfectly...I was a very happy customer!\\n\\nWe also ordered the omakase after realizing it was offered from reading the chalk board hanging over the sushi bar.  Next time I am just going for the $38 meal. You get three appetizers and the chef's choices.  Deep fried baby octopus was great! And surprisingly the monk fish liver was one of my favorite things to eat that night!  Nigiri galore!  I want to go back already!  \\n\\nI got there at 6pm yesterday and the wait list already started! When the bar opened I opt for faster seating! Make sure you indicate that table and bar seating is what you would like when writing on the wait list.  I suggest you get there eArly! There's a parking lot across the street and not a far walk from downtown mountain view.  Service is great!  If you haven't given this place a try, make sure it's on your to eat list!\", u\"I've came here many many times with my mom (because she is a baller, and I'm broke cant afford expensive sushi places lol)\\n\\nThe sushi is indeed fresh but bento box are fairly small, last time my salmon teriyaki was incredibly small that i had to order their $17 hamachi sashimi after lol\\n\\nThe bill came out to be $70 for us two, DAYMMM i can eat so much other food with that kind of money lol #collegestudentlife\", u\"I'm not from the area so when I asked my friends where their absolute go to place for sushi is and they highly recommended Sushi Tomi, of course I had to stop by! And boy,  I'm glad I did! I got the extra special nigiri lunch which usually comes with uni but they were out :( Still delicious though!\\n\\nThe place is small and it's street parking but there is a meter lot right across from it! If you're going for lunch, I world say try to get there like 10 mins before opening and you won't have to wait long!\", u\"Catching up with a girlfriend down south after a long day of work. Sudden memory recall. I was often in this part of town in early 90s, at the time, with a boyfriend from Chicago, and we ate nothing but sushi. Terribly short lived romance but excellent meals.\\n\\nGirlfriend and I have known each other for nearly two decades. So happy to see her. We ordered the sashimi combo and grilled squid. Spent a lot of time catching up. Tea was quite nice. The place was exceptionally packed for a Monday evening. I could see why because the fish was quite fresh and clearly it has a following.\\n\\nI know nothing about the south bay any more, but for a place of meet and greet, and grab something decent to eat, and if time is no issue, this is a great place to try your patience. You'd be rewarded, clearly, because the fish is quite good, and there is no shortage of patrons waiting for your seats to allow you to appreciate your good judgment for coming here.\\n\\nThough, having been spoiled rotten in Japan with exceptionally good sushi, and with the handful of sushi joints that continue to wow me elsewhere in the bay area, this place's lackluster performance makes me think one thing and one thing only, there is a definite shortage of really good sushi joints in the south bay, and it's time to head back up the shore.\", u\"Ahhh....nothing like authentic sushi and Japanese dishes. When I am craving for light, clean and crisp flavors, I head on over to good 'ol Sushi Tomi!\\n\\nMy faves:\\n\\nSalmon Ochazuke - light, flavorful, clean.\\nButabara - smaller but chunkier pieces than other izakayas in the Bay (but please know this is not an izakaya restaurant)\\n\\nAnnnnd... I can't remember anymore because I started this review last year and just realized I never posted it. Anyways, just go because this place is way better then others out there. Just expect to get more simple authentic dishes and not GIANT rolls that won't even fit in your mouth.\", u\"Hands down my favorite sushi joint in the area. Super fresh and delicious sushi rolls, sashimi, and hot dishes. Expect a wait during lunch/dinner time - for a reason!\\n\\nToday, me and my high school friend tried the DRAGON ROLL (shrimp tempura, avocado, $11), the SPICY TUNA ($9) - the rice was as very soft and delightful - and the obvious MISO SOUP. They also offer entrees such as Teriyaki Chicken but I haven't tried any of those.\\n\\nYou're guaranteed to get a decent value for your buck - well presented, fresh sushi. Like!\", u\"We came here on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm and ended up waiting about 1.5 hours before getting in. It's a pretty small place, so be prepared to wait for a while.\\n\\nWe ordered the special chirashi, the tomi roll with spicy tuna, salmon toro nigiri, and the katsu don. The special chirashi was really pretty and included a wide assortment of fish and accompaniments. The sashimi here is really fresh, and the salmon was very soft and delicious. The tomi roll was really good as well. The katsu don was pretty bland, so I wouldn't recommend it. The salmon toro was what made our meal though. I've actually never seen salmon toro at a sushi place, and now I wish every restaurant offered it. The salmon was so buttery and melt-in-your-mouth! I'd come back just for the salmon toro.\", u\"Why this place is so popular remains a mystery to me. I can instantly name so many alternatives that are far superior...\\n\\nWe came here on a Sunday for lunch, and waited quite a while to be seated. We had justifiably high expectations, but honestly its food didn't live up to the hype, and the price point is too high for the portion and the quality.\\n\\nI judge my Japanese place by its mackerel, so of course, I got a mackerel lunch special. I was underwhelmed. The fish was over salted and not grilled enough to render the fat. This is an instant turn-off for me, as an authentic japanese restaurant would know how to grill its mackerel to perfection like no others. Further, the fish was not offered as a whole, but in two awkwardly short chunky pieces. This is so far the least impressive mackerel I have had in the south bay. The pork tonkatsu was just okey, a bit over fried.\\n\\nHusband and friend got chirashi bowls. The sashimi/rice potion is really off. There was A LOT of rice yet very little fish. You can see half of the bowl is occupied by lettuce leaves! The fish selection does not live up to its price. For $28, you get 2 measly slices of tuna and 1 slice of salmon--and yet they are not even the good cuts--and lots of lettuce and meaningless fillers for the empty space. This is really disappointing.\\n\\nSome reviews suggest (without verification) that the fish was from Japan... So what? If it is not fatty, buttery, melting, and heavenly like it should be, do I really care if it is from Japan or Jamaica? Does the port of export really equate high quality? Me think not...\\n\\nService is friendly but the entire time we felt rushed.\\n\\nSo... overall I haven't warmed up to Sushi Tomi because of the poor value and the surprisingly unsatisfactory food. Back to Japantown...\", u'This has become one of my favorite places for fresh fish and sushi. If it wasn\\'t so far, I\\'d probably be here everyday and living on the streets cause I couldn\\'t pay rent.\\n\\nThe fish here is extremely fresh and delicious. I don\\'t really get anything else. Chriashi bowls, sake bowls, hamachi kama, and other sushi or sashimi items are my go-tos. Plus they have my absolute favorite fish/cut here: sake toro AKA fatty salmon. Aww yeah!\\n\\nThe service is the reason I\\'m knocking off one star. The chefs seem okay, nothing special. But the servers are usually pretty cold and our waters are usually pretty low. They\\'ll lie about the wait time and I\\'ve watched them tell multiple parties that the wait time is \"30 minutes\", no matter how long the list is.\\n\\nAnyways... fish. Fresh fish. I\\'m down.', u'we went in a group of six and was very satisfied with the service...\\nnigiri lunch set was great and mini chirashi don is also awesome\\n\\ni had the tsukiji sashimi and am glad that it was wayyyy better than sashimi lunch i had last time', u\"I have to say that is one of a very few sushi places that the quality of the food is worth waiting for.  There are not many sushi places that a run by a Japanese owner, not that it matters. But the quality shows and the food taste fresh. Especially if you like raw fish.  The quality of the fish is high grade thus the higher prices.  But it's worth a try.  \\nOnly thing lacking in this place is customer service.  It's so busy with very little help,  it's hard to flag down the waiter.  Once they drop off your food, your on your own until the check arrives.\", u\"Was craving sushi and trusted the high reviews on Yelp.\\n\\nIt was after work and I was starved. I came here wanting something super filling and satisfying but was kind of disappointed. Service took a bit of time, maybe each minute was further exaggerated by my hunger but I was getting kind of pissy.\\n\\nThen the food finally came and made everything better. I got the tomi special roll while the bf got the chirashi. I felt like all of the portions were kind of small or maybe I was just really hungry. The roll was nicely plated and came with a drizzle of sriracha mayo, which was a nice touch. The chirashi only came with 7 pieces of fish and a few pieces of other fillers. After devouring my roll, I was hungry enough to go down the street and devour a sandwich.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, everything tasted great and was of good quality. I just felt like I spent a little much for barely putting a dent on my hunger pangs.\", u\"After moving from San Jose to Sunnyvale, I had to look for another sushi joint as Cha Cha Sushi (my fave sushi restaurant) was just too far. After browsing through yelp, trying some sushi places nearby, I finally found this gem. Every time I go it's always busy and there's always a wait. Even at 8pm! I still think it's worth the wait though as I've never had to wait longer than 30 mins. The workers here are very nice. The place is pretty small and the decor is just okay.  \\nI've tried a few nigiris, rolls, hand rolls, and all were pretty good. The sashimi was very fresh but the size varies. The first time I went they ran out of oysters, but the second time I was able to order some.. boy were they delicious! Very fresh and tasty. This isn't the best sushi joint I've been to, but it is the best I've found in this area so far. Will be coming back :-)\", u'I really liked the sushi here. However, I docked a star because of the long wait- my friend and I waited for 45 minutes for a seat Friday around 8PM. When you walk in, you immediately see the sushi bar seating in front of the very pro sushi chefs, who are busy prepping for meals and slicing the fish in the oh-so-fine way. There are seats at the bar, as well as a some in the adjacent room. The space is very limited. Just walking through to our seats, we had trouble maneuvering past the chairs and tables. There were wooden booths/benches on the wall, but we were seated right next to the kitchen, which was distracting. The waiter was prompt to give us tea and take our order, but they ran out of specific items, like the gyoza.\\n\\nWe ordered the agedashi tofu, tomi roll, spicy tuna roll, and unagi don. I really enjoyed the tomi roll, the raw fish tasted fresh and fatty, and it worked nicely with the avocado.  The  sauce had a kick to it and the thinly sliced red raw onions added another dimension to the roll. I\\'ve never had a roll prepared like this before. Really interesting. The spicy tuna roll was good. It had a higher salt content than I would have like, but the \"spicy\" flavor was definitely there. I was disappointed with the agedashi tofu, because I\\'ve had a lot better, the tempura skin seemed to kind of melt off TOO easily. The unagi don was not good. The unagi was overcooked and too chewy.\\n\\nService was good and prompt.', u\"Ok so, I love sushi as much as anyone on Yelp would.\\n\\nI could go as far to say that, I've been fortunate to try a wide spectrum of it (haven't been to Tsukiji, Jiro's, or Urasawa), but I believe I got a good understanding of quality when it comes to the good stuff.\\n\\nSushi Tomi, for me would be on the medium to almost high-premium end, depending on what you purchase.\\n\\nWe got the following items:\\n\\nOmakase 10 piece (no appetizers) w/ added fresh wasabi: (instagram.com/p/1uEm5bnh\\u2026)\\nChiraishi Bowl: (instagram.com/p/1uEaylnh\\u2026)\\nChu Toro and Scallops (instagram.com/p/1uD4tpnh\\u2026)\\nTomi Special Roll: instagram.com/p/1uE5uWHh\\u2026)\\n\\nThe Omakase was fresh, everything showcased what a traditional (and authentic) Japanese Sushi spot in America, should follow suit by. A range of tangy, salty, sweet, and savory all at once. The biggest mistake was forgetting to add the fresh wasabi. I felt stupid, think they would put it on the board instead of misplacing it last minute.\\n\\nChiraishi Bowl was deemed tasty to the lady so no complaints there, didn't really try so can't compliment.\\n\\nChu Toro and Scallops were fresh and on point. Was hoping for Ootoro, but beggars can't be choosers when there's no supply.\\n\\nThe best item, is their specialty roll, the Tomi, wrapped in seared salmon and scallops is not only affordable ($14.00/pp order) but very filling. If I wasn't curious for the Omakase, I would've ordered four of these rolls instead. You can customize the inside components, but the outside remains the same. The sauce is the standard spicy sushi roll but the savory and sweetness blends really well for this particular roll. Nothing like it anywhere in the entire Bay Area (or South Bay even)\\n\\nOverall, customer service was nice and seating was a bit cramped. It took a while to get orders 20-25 minutes and you're bound to wait at least 25 minutes outside (at peak service hours).\\n\\nI'll rate this a 3.5 but bumped up to a 4, due to reasonable sushi prices, that would almost rival one of my favorite spots (Tekka Japanese Restaurant, San Francisco, CA; Inner Richmond).\", u\"Word of Warning: If you're looking for a diabetes inducing, ooey gooey roll with an endless drizzle of kabayaki sauce, you would be better served by going to a Mizu or Kenji. However, if you're looking for a no nonsense traditional sushi restaurant where most of the staff are actually Japanese, then I suggest you give Sushi Tomi a roll.\\n\\nNestled on a dark quiet side street off Castro St(which represents downtown Mountain View), the first two things you will probably notice, when arriving during dinner time, is there will inevitably be a few bodies huddled on the dark sidewalk with interesting shadows created by the light breaking through the window. Once you're seated you will notice the tightly spaced light colored wooden furniture throughout, accentuated by the bright overhead lighting.\\n\\nI was pleased with the Tako and Unagi(fresher than most) Nigiri, and the grilled whole squid which had a nice consistency(not over cooked) and produced a pleasant slightly smoky taste. The Sashimi dinner had thick,sizable, even cuts(even though a number of reviewers have complained about the amateur cutting they're experienced here recently).\\n\\nIn my opinion, Sushi Tomi represents a fair value for what they serve and when I'm in the area this is still one of my favorite Sushi restaurants.\", u\"Sushi is on point, especially the sashimi.\\n\\nOverall good, but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I would've given this place 5 solid stars. Came on a Wednesday night at around 6pm, and the wait was around 15 minutes! Not sure how long the weekend would be...\\n\\nOrdered:\\nExtra Special Sashimi: 4/5 fresh, delicious\\nTomi Special Roll: 4/5 delicious as well\", u\"Decided to give this place a shot based upon the fact that it is highly rated and has the most reviews of any sushi spot in Mountain View. Since we were in the city of Mountain View, we went for it.\\n\\nI was a bit let down. There are plenty and I mean plenty of places better than this spot for sushi/Japanese food in the bay area. First, there is a decent wait. When you're the best reviewed sushi spot  in Mountain View, you're going to get people driving in droves to visit.\\n\\nTheir actual sushi menu is a bit on the limited side. They have the fundamentals, but in this day and age, we are above the expected. It's the unexpected that has everyone jumping for joy in the streets. Their rolls are also a bit on the smaller side. However, I can't complain for the taste. All the rolls tasted fresh, and in essence, that's pretty darn important.\\n\\nThe service was kinda weird. They started off fast and efficient and then began to drag their feet. The food came in bursts, rather than a unified whole. My cousin had to wait 10 extra minutes for his grilled squid after we all got our food.\\n\\nOverall, this place is nothing special. In a region where sushi spots are all over the place, there are many better alternates.\", u'Pricing: Good-Expensive. Really up there, but it\\'s sashimi after all.\\nQuality: Good. Fresh, but I have had fresher.\\nTurnaround: Good. We had to wait in the cold, but we managed.\\nService: Good-Excellent. Our server accommodated us by replacing uni with other sashimi.\\n\\nWe ordered the chirashi, which comes in several \"tiers\" of quality depending on the type sashimi and possibly in amount too beginning at $14.00. We ordered the $19.00 for the toro option and I was a little surprised at the small amount of sashimi over rice we received. However, our server was nice in letting the kitchen know to replace the uni with other types of sashimi since we never acquired a taste for urchin. This would mean a cheaper meal for them to make so of course they would do it. Although marbled, the toro was not as smooth as I expected and the pricing is comparable to a very fresh sashimi restaurant I been to in San Francisco where the sashimi was so fresh, they almost tasted sweet. However, the fish here is fresh and still of excellent quality though not as high as I expected so no real complaints there. There was a wait when we arrived and because of the small restaurant, we had wait out in the cold. Luckily, there was a group of us so we huddled and managed to survive until they called our name.', u'Overall best sushi in mountain view Castro St.! Super reasonable pricing for quality and legit tasting authentic Japanese food. All sushi chefs appear to be from Japan. Staff is attentive even though the lunch rush is epic! Get there early as tables fill endlessly and a line and wait surely will await for you!\\n\\nSome memorable moments include: hamachi toro, toro, and uni all imported and on point especially in price!', u'Solid sushi joint in downtown Mountain View! It\\'s a pretty small restaurant, nothing fancy, and seems relatively busy during lunch (at the very least), but the wait wasn\\'t more than 10 minutes around 1pm for a table for 2.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty simple: mostly bento boxes, noodles, sashimi and sushi. It\\'s not one of those sushi places you\\'d go to for those fancy, creative rolls. Food came out pretty quickly, but I was surprised they didn\\'t automatically give us or at least offer water.\\n\\n====================\\n\\nI ordered:\\n\\nREGULAR CHIRASHI ($17) - 4.5/5\\nCame with miso soup. I thought the bowl was very reasonably priced for the portion size. It came with 2 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, 1 yellowtail, 1 white fish, 1 shrimp, 1 surf clam, 1 tamago, 2 fish cakes, some veggies (cucumber, seaweed and something else) and a huge portion of sushi rice. And the sashimi were thick cuts! All pretty fresh but a slice or two were still on the cold side. The texture of the sashimi was soft for the most part, but not quite the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth kind of sashimi. One of the slices of tuna was kind of stringy and \"gamey\" though, but overall, very solid and definitely worth the price. I really liked the tamago/egg too!', u\"Discovered this place when my friends and I had a fail attempt to go to Crepevine in downtown Mountain View earlier to have some late lunch. So I've searched for other places that had at least 4 yelp stars with lots of reviews and found Sushi Tomi. We parked where the nearby garage is at so it was a bit far but we didn't mind the walk since it was a nice stroll along downtown.\\n\\nI got to the bento box - chicken teriyaki, saba, sashimi and tempura. It was delicious. I never really had an idea what the hell saba was until my food arrived; it was just a grilled fish and you put some lemon and salt if you wish or just eat it without it. I had three huge pieces Tuna sashimi and I was surprised how thick the cut was. Usually, sushi places will serve you about 4-5 sashimi pieces but they area tiny portion.\\n\\nService was good as well. Our waitress checked up on us from time to time to see if we needed something else - mostly refill of water and extra napkins.\\n\\nThis is definitely my go-to spot in downtown Mountain View if I want something affordable and yummy!\", u'I came here again and I was so... underwhelmed... I ordered the Tomi Special roll again, and they BARELY gave me any seared salmon! It was strange. And, the salmon sashimi was not as yummy as I remembered it being. I was extremely underwhelmed.\\n\\nMaybe my review will change again in the future.... but for now.............. I vant to geev u 3 stars, but the waiters are so nice and friendly here you get an extra +bump for that :D woot woot', u'soooo my cousin, Jennifer Y. is completely addicted to this place. She raves about this PLACE ALL THE TIME. so of course one of the days my other cousin from canada flew in, we had to try this place out. We came after work so around 830, the wait was about 15-20 min AND THEY RAN OUT OF SALMONNN  ): ):\\n\\nThe restaurant is an average size, but it looks small and crowded bc the tables are kinda close together to they try and fit more people. We were helped right away with tea and water. We ordered a few rolls and 1-2 huge plates of sashimi. Everything was super good! I remember we got the sushi tomi roll, which was delicious. The fatty tuna (toro) was to DIE FORRR!!! omgg it was sooo buttery and just melted in my mouth. Really made me appreciate the different kinds of sashimi more. They also had UNI!! It was my first time trying and we were given a small portion on our sashimi plate. Kinda smushy but i liked it! My cousin didnt because the piece he got still had a slight distinct fishy taste/smell to it.\\n\\nOverall, although they ran out of salmon, the sushi and sashimi we got were still really good. The waitstaff accommodated to our needs and was nice and helpful. I can see why customers keep coming back to eat!', u'I was craving sushi one night for dinner and found this place on Yelp. I\\'m surprised I haven\\'t heard of this place!\\n\\nOn a Saturday night the wait for two was 30-40 mins. We didn\\'t get a table however, but we were fine sitting at the sushi bar.\\n\\nI love chirashi and after seeing all the pictures on Yelp, I knew I had to order it. What we ordered: uni shooters, an order of sake toro, hamachi toro, and white tuna nigiri, an unagi don, an extra special chirashi, and the tomi special roll. We also ordered the ankimo (monkfish liver) appetizer, but it never came. We were honestly so full from the food that I was a bit grateful they forgot our ankimo. Our dinner also came with complimentary bowls of miso soup. We also received a complimentary side salad which I think came with the unagi don.\\n\\nThe sushi was delicious. The sake toro was definitely very memorable and a must try. The salmon belly was very buttery with fat marbled nicely, tender and just delicious. I\\'ll definitely have to order more of it next time. The other fish were all very fresh and delicious too. The extra special chirashi was amazing as well with a great selection of sashimi. Their uni was also very good, wasn\\'t grainy at all. I think I prefer the uni nigiri over the uni shooters, but that\\'s just my personal preference. I definitely have to try their ankimo next time.\\n\\nTheir prices are on the pricier side for sushi, but it\\'s definitely worth it. Our bill came out to be around $123.\\n\\nService was pretty good. Waitresses are attentive and speedy. However, when I told the waitress that we didn\\'t get the ankimo, she had to confirm with the sushi chefs and the sushi chef told her \"if they say they didn\\'t get it then they didn\\'t get it, just write it off\". I mean this conversation happened in front of us. I found it a bit rude, especially since they sounded like they didn\\'t believe us. I would have still requested it if I was still hungry. But that scene was just baffling.\\n\\nOverall, 4 stars for their sushi, but 2 stars for their service.', u\"Love their lunch specials! $10.95 for a bento boxes with two items (i.e. chicken teriyaki + sashimi) is solid. Fills me up every time and the service is lightning speed. Almost too fast... You will literally get one minute to look at the menu before they come take your order, and if you tell them you're not ready yet, they'll give another one minute. They're so busy and the demand is so high that they kinda want you to eat and leave. Still, I love this place for the high food quality.\\n\\nOn another occasion, I and another person spent $180 before tip on just sashimi. Yeah.... IT ADDS UP, especially if you order all toro..... :D  They have salmon toro, yellowtail toro, and tuna toro. All delicious but expen$$$ive.\\n\\nYou best get there when it opens at 11:30am or it will be hard to get seating!\", u'The actual sushi at Sushi Tomi is absolutely delicious- some of the freshest sashimi I have tried in the Bay Area! Unfortunately, my reasoning for the three stars simply has to do with the organization of the restaurant. For one- it is challenging to phone in an order as the menu online is difficult to navigate. They have several different menus they use at the actual restaurant that are not all posted online. The reason for my frustration is the line to pick up your food at Sushi Tomi is combined with the \"waiting to be seated\" line which is always completely slammed. Also, the area to wait is so small that most people have to wait outside!\\n\\nThree stars until they figure out the organization. Four stars for the actual cuisine. Check out the restaurant and you will see what I\\'m talking about...', u'Sushi Tomi? More like Sushi Tummy. As in, \"get in my tummy, now!\".\\n\\nI ordered the lunch combo ($10.90) which comes with two choices of entree items, salad, rice and miso soup. I opted for teriyaki chicken and teriyaki salmon. The chicken was crispy (mainly due to the skin being left on) and the salmon was flavorful. The sweet teriyaki sauce was quite enjoyable. And bonus points for the hearty miso soup, which came with small tofu cubes and green onion.\\n\\nThe wife ordered the daily special (also $10.90) which was the chirashi bowl with salmon and tuna. The sushi: very fresh. Me: very envious.\\n\\nWe also splurged for an order of salmon avocado rolls and California rolls; each was $6.90 for six pieces, and each was fantastic. I really think we needed at least two more orders of these...\\n\\nThe waitstaff was genuinely friendly with good service to boot. The only bad thing about this place is the long line outside!', u\"Probably my favorite place to get sushi in MV.\\n\\nIt's consistently good, portions are decent, and fish is fresh. It gets packed so make sure you beat the dinner/lunch crowd or you're waiting.\\n\\nI highly recommend getting their sushi plates or their lunch/dinner combos. This place isn't too big on rolls so there's not a lot of options. I love their nigiri combos because it's the perfect amount of food and the fish is fresh and tasty! Their chirashi bowls also look good but that tends to be too much rice for me. Their lunch/dinner combos are actually pretty filling. I usually get the chicken terriyaki in combination with sashimi or spicy tuna roll. Their chicken is grilled just how I like it, which is to the point you can taste that charred/seared portion of the chicken and they don't go super heavy on the sauce which is nice!\\n\\nTheir prices are a higher than other sushi restaurants in the area but worth it if you're a fan of quality fish.\", u\"Yeah, I don't know why people recommend this place to highly. The service staff is lovely, but the sushi chefs are LAZY. Last night, they couldn't even summon the energy to get rice all the way around my rainbow roll. The rice was sorta squished around three-fourths of the circumference with over-mayo'd crab sticking to the plate.\\nTo my utter disappointment, the hotate was prepared with too much wasabi. I like hotate nigiri when it tastes like butter. I should have ordered it sabi-nuki. My nose was on fire.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the spicy tuna roll was excellent.\\n\\nNext time I'll stick to my guns and go to Yakko Sushi up the street. I like that place a lot better, and it's less expensive.\", u\"I can see why Sushi Tomi is a popular place.\\n\\nI enjoyed the sashimi selection which was reasonably priced at $33.  I can find no fault in the freshness of their fish, however, I did find a bone in my salmon!  Chef? please double check next time, nothing turns me off than having to stop chewing midway so I don't stab the roof of my mouth with fish bone.\\n\\nDon't skip the appetizers, it showcases a variety of grilled items which are perfect for sharing! The chicken skin is so good with just the right amount of crispness and the charcoal markings are so tasty.  I'd skip the beef tongue, it is tough and chewy -- I've had better tongue elsewhere (TWSS?)\\n\\nI wouldn't categorize Sushi Tomi as a destination resto, but definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.\", u\"Sashimi had to be doused in wasabi and soy sauce to get rid of the awful fishy flavor! The staff was pretty standard but the food arrive fast. I definitely wouldn't consider this one of the better sushi places in Mountain View!\", u'Came by for dinner the other night and it was impressive.\\n\\nStarted off with the miso soup and it was slightly better than the one on Moorpark, although a tad salty.\\n\\nMoved on to the Unagi Don which had 4 huge pieces of thick cuts of Unagi. The rice was fluffy and flavorful while the Unagi was excellent. There was also a small piece of the egg too! :)\\n\\nService was friendly by the staff.\\n\\n~$24 after tax and tip for dinner.', u'I kind of hate this place (for a few reasons below), yet I\\'ve continued to go back. I\\'ve been coming here on and off for the past 2 years, but it seems like there was some sort of management change in the last year. Not a good one either.\\n\\nWHY I HATE THIS PLACE:\\n- Sushi quality has declined in the past year.\\n- The sushi cuts are getting bigger and bigger, and the knife work is pretty sloppy.\\n- The menu has some authentic dishes, but the execution of these dishes is not (eg, oshitashi, goma ae, is seriously lacking umami). For comparison, the goma ae at Akane in Los Altos is amazing.\\n- Also, the service/atmosphere has become very \"Chinese\", if you know what I mean (with the exception of one nice waitress). More quantity, less quality, and you can feel the difference in the details. I hope I can get a pass on saying this because I\\'m half Chinese / half Japanese.\\n\\nWHY I STILL GO BACK:\\n- It\\'s 3 blocks away.\\n\\nWHY I WON\\'T GO BACK FOR A WHILE:\\n- The last time I came here, the whole place smelled musky and pungently fishy at the same time. Probably just a one-time thing, but really unappetizing.\\n- Kappo Nami Nami!', u\"It seems like I can never get the name right... Tomi Sushi or Sushi Tomi?  In any case, you always know, it's the Japanese restaurants with the mundane names in a small, crowded venue of traditional wooden fixtures that turn out to be the best.\\n\\nThe sashimi quality is probably one of the better ones in Norcal, and they stay true to authenticity--they have good honest maki, not just an entire page of colorful deep-fried piles of sushi swimming in sauce.  \\n\\nWhen at a place with decent sashimi, there is no doubt that the chirashi is a must-try: they have regular, special, and extra special.  Seeing that I am not a fan of fish roe and prefer the basic stuff, I get REGULAR CHIRASHI ($17) and I am ecstatic--chirashis are shrinking in many restaurants into well-manicured little displays of sashimi, but Sushi Tomi gives you a no-frills, no-skimping generous box of sushi rice topped with several thick slices of fish.\\n\\nIf you want something fancier, they do have the TOMI SPECIAL ROLL ($13.40) which is quite delicious.  I think it would have been more delicious if it came with a description.  From my experience, I would describe it as a roll with a choice of spicy tuna, salmon, or hamachi filling, wrapped in slightly burnt rice and topped with seared albacore.  There's a side of spicy orange sauce and a beautiful garnish of onions and sprouts--it has all the elements of modern cuisine, yet it is not overdone and still has the high-quality sashimi.\\n\\nIf raw fish does not fancy you, the entrees are good as well.  CHICKEN TERIYAKI and CALIFORNIA ROLLS don't sound all too exciting, but here it's simple comfort food.\\n\\nLastly, be sure to come for the amazing LUNCH SPECIALS, (secret: even on weekends!)  Many times there is sashimi, the same delicious Tomi Sushi sashimi, made extremely affordable if you don't mind getting the less aesthetic cuts of the odds and ends.\\n\\nThe complimentary hot green tea is quite comforting, especially when served in a classic Tomi Sushi mug.  It's fairly plain an a fairly oldschool shade of pale blue, but it's exactly these quaint little details that give good Japanese restaurants their charm.\", u\"This is a solid and authentic japanese restaurant nestled in mountain view. I don't think too highly of the South Bay in regards to sushi but sushi tomi really surprised me.\\n\\nThings to know:\\n- Arrive upon opening time to avoid waiting in line otherwise come with patience as the lines can get long\\n- Chirashi is really good. I love their rice.. It is some of the best in my opinion\\n- Tomi special roll is an absolute must\", u\"The hype brought me here. I've walked past this restaurant many times and didn't think much of it. It's very unassuming, whole in the wall type. However, considering all the positive reviews we gave it a try.\\n\\nWord is the wait can get quite long, but we came at 815PM on a Sunday evening so it was only ~15 minutes. I ordered the Extra Special Nigiri dinner and my boyfriend ordered the Combination Special: Salmon Teriyaki and Chicken Sukiyaki.\\n\\nHis sukiyaki was good, homestyle-like; nothing fancy and prepared in the kitchen vs at our table. As part of a combination dinner, that's to be expected though. The other dishes were just ok. Boyfriend said salmon was semi-dry and my nigiri was meh. They were out of Sake which wasn't the end of the world so they substituted Hamachi per my request instead. I also got schooled by ordering the Extra Special, but didn't get Toro. Didn't realize until was too late.\\n\\nBottom line: the food fell flat.\", u'I was able to get a table here after an hour or so wait. Sushi Tomi seems to be a more traditional sushi place that focuses more on basic sashimi and rolls instead of the more complex rolls seen at other sushi places.\\n\\nWe ordered the extra special sashimi plate and the regular chirashi bowl. In addition to staples like salmon and regular tuna, the extra special plate has sea snail, uni, ebi, toro, and amberjack. The regular chirashi bowl had more of the standard lineup of fish, but I imagine getting the extra special chirashi would be similar to the extra special sashimi plate.\\n\\nOverall, the fish was very fresh but the 1 hr+ waits (no option for reservation) and the slightly higher price point is something to consider. The wealth of sushi places in the area makes me feel like I could find another place with a shorter wait and lower price even if it is slightly worse in quality. Sushi Tomi is undoubtedly a quality sushi restaurant though and worth a try if you are willing to wait.', u\"The wait is crazy here FYI, but I would say it was worth it! :)\\n\\nChef's Choice Sashimi\\n--The lean tuna and salmon cuts tasted very fresh and the texture was great! I tried Amber Jack for the first time and although it had too strong of a fishy taste, I enjoyed the moderately fatty texture. The toro wasn't my cup of tea but it was fresh nonetheless. I did not like the taste of the Uni and probably will never eat that again (once again my preference and not the way it was prepared). I had the hardest time eating the sea snails because it reminds me of the times I killed snails in my backyard. Anyhow, I like the texture more than the taste or the thought of eating snails. The white fish's texture was in between a crunchy and jelly consistency, which I didn't quite like. The flavor of the fish I didn't particularly enjoy either. I thought overall I experienced a lot of raw seafood and also got to eat fresh, delicious standard cuts like tuna and salmon.\\n\\nExtra Special Chirashi\\n-This had some of the standard sashimi cuts including tuna and salmon. The seaweed and mushrooms on the side were a great addition! The egg was a bit too sweet! The rice was chewy and not too sticky. Yay!\\n\\nI am giving this place a four star because the seafood is very fresh. I would love to come back to try some of the fun appetizers though!\", u\"MMMMMMM!!! SASHIMI LUNCH! SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK!\\n\\nJust writing this is making my mouth water so let's get to it before I ruin my keyboard.\\n\\nAmbiance:  This place is decent sized for Castro but because it's so yummy there will always be a wait at lunch.  Cool and casual, there is nothing to complain about (unless they can expand the place!)\\n\\nService: My service was good even though the place was slammed.  I'm sure they're used to that level of traffic by now.\\n\\nFood: SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK! I ordered the sashimi lunch under recommendation of my waitress and boy am I glad I did!.  They were served at a perfect temperature and I was given a fairly large portion considering the cost of the lunch deal.  The star of the meal was the SALMON! The cut was so fatty the fish had an almost smoky flavor to it even though it was raw.  I can still taste it in my mouth just thinking about it.  I eat a lot of sushi and I've never had salmon so flavorful.  *shudders*\\n\\nWhat else can I say.  Will be back.  Will get salmon again.  Long wait, don't care.\", u\"This place is now my favorite sushi restaurant!\\n\\nEverything we ordered yesterday was delicious!  Simple, yet fresh!\\n\\nSashimi dinner all just melted in the mouth and the fresh oysters were prepared perfectly...I was a very happy customer!\\n\\nWe also ordered the omakase after realizing it was offered from reading the chalk board hanging over the sushi bar.  Next time I am just going for the $38 meal. You get three appetizers and the chef's choices.  Deep fried baby octopus was great! And surprisingly the monk fish liver was one of my favorite things to eat that night!  Nigiri galore!  I want to go back already!  \\n\\nI got there at 6pm yesterday and the wait list already started! When the bar opened I opt for faster seating! Make sure you indicate that table and bar seating is what you would like when writing on the wait list.  I suggest you get there eArly! There's a parking lot across the street and not a far walk from downtown mountain view.  Service is great!  If you haven't given this place a try, make sure it's on your to eat list!\", u\"I've came here many many times with my mom (because she is a baller, and I'm broke cant afford expensive sushi places lol)\\n\\nThe sushi is indeed fresh but bento box are fairly small, last time my salmon teriyaki was incredibly small that i had to order their $17 hamachi sashimi after lol\\n\\nThe bill came out to be $70 for us two, DAYMMM i can eat so much other food with that kind of money lol #collegestudentlife\", u\"I'm not from the area so when I asked my friends where their absolute go to place for sushi is and they highly recommended Sushi Tomi, of course I had to stop by! And boy,  I'm glad I did! I got the extra special nigiri lunch which usually comes with uni but they were out :( Still delicious though!\\n\\nThe place is small and it's street parking but there is a meter lot right across from it! If you're going for lunch, I world say try to get there like 10 mins before opening and you won't have to wait long!\", u\"Catching up with a girlfriend down south after a long day of work. Sudden memory recall. I was often in this part of town in early 90s, at the time, with a boyfriend from Chicago, and we ate nothing but sushi. Terribly short lived romance but excellent meals.\\n\\nGirlfriend and I have known each other for nearly two decades. So happy to see her. We ordered the sashimi combo and grilled squid. Spent a lot of time catching up. Tea was quite nice. The place was exceptionally packed for a Monday evening. I could see why because the fish was quite fresh and clearly it has a following.\\n\\nI know nothing about the south bay any more, but for a place of meet and greet, and grab something decent to eat, and if time is no issue, this is a great place to try your patience. You'd be rewarded, clearly, because the fish is quite good, and there is no shortage of patrons waiting for your seats to allow you to appreciate your good judgment for coming here.\\n\\nThough, having been spoiled rotten in Japan with exceptionally good sushi, and with the handful of sushi joints that continue to wow me elsewhere in the bay area, this place's lackluster performance makes me think one thing and one thing only, there is a definite shortage of really good sushi joints in the south bay, and it's time to head back up the shore.\", u\"Ahhh....nothing like authentic sushi and Japanese dishes. When I am craving for light, clean and crisp flavors, I head on over to good 'ol Sushi Tomi!\\n\\nMy faves:\\n\\nSalmon Ochazuke - light, flavorful, clean.\\nButabara - smaller but chunkier pieces than other izakayas in the Bay (but please know this is not an izakaya restaurant)\\n\\nAnnnnd... I can't remember anymore because I started this review last year and just realized I never posted it. Anyways, just go because this place is way better then others out there. Just expect to get more simple authentic dishes and not GIANT rolls that won't even fit in your mouth.\", u\"Hands down my favorite sushi joint in the area. Super fresh and delicious sushi rolls, sashimi, and hot dishes. Expect a wait during lunch/dinner time - for a reason!\\n\\nToday, me and my high school friend tried the DRAGON ROLL (shrimp tempura, avocado, $11), the SPICY TUNA ($9) - the rice was as very soft and delightful - and the obvious MISO SOUP. They also offer entrees such as Teriyaki Chicken but I haven't tried any of those.\\n\\nYou're guaranteed to get a decent value for your buck - well presented, fresh sushi. Like!\", u\"We came here on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm and ended up waiting about 1.5 hours before getting in. It's a pretty small place, so be prepared to wait for a while.\\n\\nWe ordered the special chirashi, the tomi roll with spicy tuna, salmon toro nigiri, and the katsu don. The special chirashi was really pretty and included a wide assortment of fish and accompaniments. The sashimi here is really fresh, and the salmon was very soft and delicious. The tomi roll was really good as well. The katsu don was pretty bland, so I wouldn't recommend it. The salmon toro was what made our meal though. I've actually never seen salmon toro at a sushi place, and now I wish every restaurant offered it. The salmon was so buttery and melt-in-your-mouth! I'd come back just for the salmon toro.\", u\"Why this place is so popular remains a mystery to me. I can instantly name so many alternatives that are far superior...\\n\\nWe came here on a Sunday for lunch, and waited quite a while to be seated. We had justifiably high expectations, but honestly its food didn't live up to the hype, and the price point is too high for the portion and the quality.\\n\\nI judge my Japanese place by its mackerel, so of course, I got a mackerel lunch special. I was underwhelmed. The fish was over salted and not grilled enough to render the fat. This is an instant turn-off for me, as an authentic japanese restaurant would know how to grill its mackerel to perfection like no others. Further, the fish was not offered as a whole, but in two awkwardly short chunky pieces. This is so far the least impressive mackerel I have had in the south bay. The pork tonkatsu was just okey, a bit over fried.\\n\\nHusband and friend got chirashi bowls. The sashimi/rice potion is really off. There was A LOT of rice yet very little fish. You can see half of the bowl is occupied by lettuce leaves! The fish selection does not live up to its price. For $28, you get 2 measly slices of tuna and 1 slice of salmon--and yet they are not even the good cuts--and lots of lettuce and meaningless fillers for the empty space. This is really disappointing.\\n\\nSome reviews suggest (without verification) that the fish was from Japan... So what? If it is not fatty, buttery, melting, and heavenly like it should be, do I really care if it is from Japan or Jamaica? Does the port of export really equate high quality? Me think not...\\n\\nService is friendly but the entire time we felt rushed.\\n\\nSo... overall I haven't warmed up to Sushi Tomi because of the poor value and the surprisingly unsatisfactory food. Back to Japantown...\", u'This has become one of my favorite places for fresh fish and sushi. If it wasn\\'t so far, I\\'d probably be here everyday and living on the streets cause I couldn\\'t pay rent.\\n\\nThe fish here is extremely fresh and delicious. I don\\'t really get anything else. Chriashi bowls, sake bowls, hamachi kama, and other sushi or sashimi items are my go-tos. Plus they have my absolute favorite fish/cut here: sake toro AKA fatty salmon. Aww yeah!\\n\\nThe service is the reason I\\'m knocking off one star. The chefs seem okay, nothing special. But the servers are usually pretty cold and our waters are usually pretty low. They\\'ll lie about the wait time and I\\'ve watched them tell multiple parties that the wait time is \"30 minutes\", no matter how long the list is.\\n\\nAnyways... fish. Fresh fish. I\\'m down.', u'we went in a group of six and was very satisfied with the service...\\nnigiri lunch set was great and mini chirashi don is also awesome\\n\\ni had the tsukiji sashimi and am glad that it was wayyyy better than sashimi lunch i had last time', u\"I have to say that is one of a very few sushi places that the quality of the food is worth waiting for.  There are not many sushi places that a run by a Japanese owner, not that it matters. But the quality shows and the food taste fresh. Especially if you like raw fish.  The quality of the fish is high grade thus the higher prices.  But it's worth a try.  \\nOnly thing lacking in this place is customer service.  It's so busy with very little help,  it's hard to flag down the waiter.  Once they drop off your food, your on your own until the check arrives.\", u\"Was craving sushi and trusted the high reviews on Yelp.\\n\\nIt was after work and I was starved. I came here wanting something super filling and satisfying but was kind of disappointed. Service took a bit of time, maybe each minute was further exaggerated by my hunger but I was getting kind of pissy.\\n\\nThen the food finally came and made everything better. I got the tomi special roll while the bf got the chirashi. I felt like all of the portions were kind of small or maybe I was just really hungry. The roll was nicely plated and came with a drizzle of sriracha mayo, which was a nice touch. The chirashi only came with 7 pieces of fish and a few pieces of other fillers. After devouring my roll, I was hungry enough to go down the street and devour a sandwich.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, everything tasted great and was of good quality. I just felt like I spent a little much for barely putting a dent on my hunger pangs.\", u\"After moving from San Jose to Sunnyvale, I had to look for another sushi joint as Cha Cha Sushi (my fave sushi restaurant) was just too far. After browsing through yelp, trying some sushi places nearby, I finally found this gem. Every time I go it's always busy and there's always a wait. Even at 8pm! I still think it's worth the wait though as I've never had to wait longer than 30 mins. The workers here are very nice. The place is pretty small and the decor is just okay.  \\nI've tried a few nigiris, rolls, hand rolls, and all were pretty good. The sashimi was very fresh but the size varies. The first time I went they ran out of oysters, but the second time I was able to order some.. boy were they delicious! Very fresh and tasty. This isn't the best sushi joint I've been to, but it is the best I've found in this area so far. Will be coming back :-)\", u'I really liked the sushi here. However, I docked a star because of the long wait- my friend and I waited for 45 minutes for a seat Friday around 8PM. When you walk in, you immediately see the sushi bar seating in front of the very pro sushi chefs, who are busy prepping for meals and slicing the fish in the oh-so-fine way. There are seats at the bar, as well as a some in the adjacent room. The space is very limited. Just walking through to our seats, we had trouble maneuvering past the chairs and tables. There were wooden booths/benches on the wall, but we were seated right next to the kitchen, which was distracting. The waiter was prompt to give us tea and take our order, but they ran out of specific items, like the gyoza.\\n\\nWe ordered the agedashi tofu, tomi roll, spicy tuna roll, and unagi don. I really enjoyed the tomi roll, the raw fish tasted fresh and fatty, and it worked nicely with the avocado.  The  sauce had a kick to it and the thinly sliced red raw onions added another dimension to the roll. I\\'ve never had a roll prepared like this before. Really interesting. The spicy tuna roll was good. It had a higher salt content than I would have like, but the \"spicy\" flavor was definitely there. I was disappointed with the agedashi tofu, because I\\'ve had a lot better, the tempura skin seemed to kind of melt off TOO easily. The unagi don was not good. The unagi was overcooked and too chewy.\\n\\nService was good and prompt.', u\"Ok so, I love sushi as much as anyone on Yelp would.\\n\\nI could go as far to say that, I've been fortunate to try a wide spectrum of it (haven't been to Tsukiji, Jiro's, or Urasawa), but I believe I got a good understanding of quality when it comes to the good stuff.\\n\\nSushi Tomi, for me would be on the medium to almost high-premium end, depending on what you purchase.\\n\\nWe got the following items:\\n\\nOmakase 10 piece (no appetizers) w/ added fresh wasabi: (instagram.com/p/1uEm5bnh\\u2026)\\nChiraishi Bowl: (instagram.com/p/1uEaylnh\\u2026)\\nChu Toro and Scallops (instagram.com/p/1uD4tpnh\\u2026)\\nTomi Special Roll: instagram.com/p/1uE5uWHh\\u2026)\\n\\nThe Omakase was fresh, everything showcased what a traditional (and authentic) Japanese Sushi spot in America, should follow suit by. A range of tangy, salty, sweet, and savory all at once. The biggest mistake was forgetting to add the fresh wasabi. I felt stupid, think they would put it on the board instead of misplacing it last minute.\\n\\nChiraishi Bowl was deemed tasty to the lady so no complaints there, didn't really try so can't compliment.\\n\\nChu Toro and Scallops were fresh and on point. Was hoping for Ootoro, but beggars can't be choosers when there's no supply.\\n\\nThe best item, is their specialty roll, the Tomi, wrapped in seared salmon and scallops is not only affordable ($14.00/pp order) but very filling. If I wasn't curious for the Omakase, I would've ordered four of these rolls instead. You can customize the inside components, but the outside remains the same. The sauce is the standard spicy sushi roll but the savory and sweetness blends really well for this particular roll. Nothing like it anywhere in the entire Bay Area (or South Bay even)\\n\\nOverall, customer service was nice and seating was a bit cramped. It took a while to get orders 20-25 minutes and you're bound to wait at least 25 minutes outside (at peak service hours).\\n\\nI'll rate this a 3.5 but bumped up to a 4, due to reasonable sushi prices, that would almost rival one of my favorite spots (Tekka Japanese Restaurant, San Francisco, CA; Inner Richmond).\", u\"Word of Warning: If you're looking for a diabetes inducing, ooey gooey roll with an endless drizzle of kabayaki sauce, you would be better served by going to a Mizu or Kenji. However, if you're looking for a no nonsense traditional sushi restaurant where most of the staff are actually Japanese, then I suggest you give Sushi Tomi a roll.\\n\\nNestled on a dark quiet side street off Castro St(which represents downtown Mountain View), the first two things you will probably notice, when arriving during dinner time, is there will inevitably be a few bodies huddled on the dark sidewalk with interesting shadows created by the light breaking through the window. Once you're seated you will notice the tightly spaced light colored wooden furniture throughout, accentuated by the bright overhead lighting.\\n\\nI was pleased with the Tako and Unagi(fresher than most) Nigiri, and the grilled whole squid which had a nice consistency(not over cooked) and produced a pleasant slightly smoky taste. The Sashimi dinner had thick,sizable, even cuts(even though a number of reviewers have complained about the amateur cutting they're experienced here recently).\\n\\nIn my opinion, Sushi Tomi represents a fair value for what they serve and when I'm in the area this is still one of my favorite Sushi restaurants.\", u\"Sushi is on point, especially the sashimi.\\n\\nOverall good, but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I would've given this place 5 solid stars. Came on a Wednesday night at around 6pm, and the wait was around 15 minutes! Not sure how long the weekend would be...\\n\\nOrdered:\\nExtra Special Sashimi: 4/5 fresh, delicious\\nTomi Special Roll: 4/5 delicious as well\", u\"Decided to give this place a shot based upon the fact that it is highly rated and has the most reviews of any sushi spot in Mountain View. Since we were in the city of Mountain View, we went for it.\\n\\nI was a bit let down. There are plenty and I mean plenty of places better than this spot for sushi/Japanese food in the bay area. First, there is a decent wait. When you're the best reviewed sushi spot  in Mountain View, you're going to get people driving in droves to visit.\\n\\nTheir actual sushi menu is a bit on the limited side. They have the fundamentals, but in this day and age, we are above the expected. It's the unexpected that has everyone jumping for joy in the streets. Their rolls are also a bit on the smaller side. However, I can't complain for the taste. All the rolls tasted fresh, and in essence, that's pretty darn important.\\n\\nThe service was kinda weird. They started off fast and efficient and then began to drag their feet. The food came in bursts, rather than a unified whole. My cousin had to wait 10 extra minutes for his grilled squid after we all got our food.\\n\\nOverall, this place is nothing special. In a region where sushi spots are all over the place, there are many better alternates.\", u'Pricing: Good-Expensive. Really up there, but it\\'s sashimi after all.\\nQuality: Good. Fresh, but I have had fresher.\\nTurnaround: Good. We had to wait in the cold, but we managed.\\nService: Good-Excellent. Our server accommodated us by replacing uni with other sashimi.\\n\\nWe ordered the chirashi, which comes in several \"tiers\" of quality depending on the type sashimi and possibly in amount too beginning at $14.00. We ordered the $19.00 for the toro option and I was a little surprised at the small amount of sashimi over rice we received. However, our server was nice in letting the kitchen know to replace the uni with other types of sashimi since we never acquired a taste for urchin. This would mean a cheaper meal for them to make so of course they would do it. Although marbled, the toro was not as smooth as I expected and the pricing is comparable to a very fresh sashimi restaurant I been to in San Francisco where the sashimi was so fresh, they almost tasted sweet. However, the fish here is fresh and still of excellent quality though not as high as I expected so no real complaints there. There was a wait when we arrived and because of the small restaurant, we had wait out in the cold. Luckily, there was a group of us so we huddled and managed to survive until they called our name.', u'Overall best sushi in mountain view Castro St.! Super reasonable pricing for quality and legit tasting authentic Japanese food. All sushi chefs appear to be from Japan. Staff is attentive even though the lunch rush is epic! Get there early as tables fill endlessly and a line and wait surely will await for you!\\n\\nSome memorable moments include: hamachi toro, toro, and uni all imported and on point especially in price!', u'Solid sushi joint in downtown Mountain View! It\\'s a pretty small restaurant, nothing fancy, and seems relatively busy during lunch (at the very least), but the wait wasn\\'t more than 10 minutes around 1pm for a table for 2.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty simple: mostly bento boxes, noodles, sashimi and sushi. It\\'s not one of those sushi places you\\'d go to for those fancy, creative rolls. Food came out pretty quickly, but I was surprised they didn\\'t automatically give us or at least offer water.\\n\\n====================\\n\\nI ordered:\\n\\nREGULAR CHIRASHI ($17) - 4.5/5\\nCame with miso soup. I thought the bowl was very reasonably priced for the portion size. It came with 2 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, 1 yellowtail, 1 white fish, 1 shrimp, 1 surf clam, 1 tamago, 2 fish cakes, some veggies (cucumber, seaweed and something else) and a huge portion of sushi rice. And the sashimi were thick cuts! All pretty fresh but a slice or two were still on the cold side. The texture of the sashimi was soft for the most part, but not quite the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth kind of sashimi. One of the slices of tuna was kind of stringy and \"gamey\" though, but overall, very solid and definitely worth the price. I really liked the tamago/egg too!', u\"Discovered this place when my friends and I had a fail attempt to go to Crepevine in downtown Mountain View earlier to have some late lunch. So I've searched for other places that had at least 4 yelp stars with lots of reviews and found Sushi Tomi. We parked where the nearby garage is at so it was a bit far but we didn't mind the walk since it was a nice stroll along downtown.\\n\\nI got to the bento box - chicken teriyaki, saba, sashimi and tempura. It was delicious. I never really had an idea what the hell saba was until my food arrived; it was just a grilled fish and you put some lemon and salt if you wish or just eat it without it. I had three huge pieces Tuna sashimi and I was surprised how thick the cut was. Usually, sushi places will serve you about 4-5 sashimi pieces but they area tiny portion.\\n\\nService was good as well. Our waitress checked up on us from time to time to see if we needed something else - mostly refill of water and extra napkins.\\n\\nThis is definitely my go-to spot in downtown Mountain View if I want something affordable and yummy!\", u'I came here again and I was so... underwhelmed... I ordered the Tomi Special roll again, and they BARELY gave me any seared salmon! It was strange. And, the salmon sashimi was not as yummy as I remembered it being. I was extremely underwhelmed.\\n\\nMaybe my review will change again in the future.... but for now.............. I vant to geev u 3 stars, but the waiters are so nice and friendly here you get an extra +bump for that :D woot woot', u'soooo my cousin, Jennifer Y. is completely addicted to this place. She raves about this PLACE ALL THE TIME. so of course one of the days my other cousin from canada flew in, we had to try this place out. We came after work so around 830, the wait was about 15-20 min AND THEY RAN OUT OF SALMONNN  ): ):\\n\\nThe restaurant is an average size, but it looks small and crowded bc the tables are kinda close together to they try and fit more people. We were helped right away with tea and water. We ordered a few rolls and 1-2 huge plates of sashimi. Everything was super good! I remember we got the sushi tomi roll, which was delicious. The fatty tuna (toro) was to DIE FORRR!!! omgg it was sooo buttery and just melted in my mouth. Really made me appreciate the different kinds of sashimi more. They also had UNI!! It was my first time trying and we were given a small portion on our sashimi plate. Kinda smushy but i liked it! My cousin didnt because the piece he got still had a slight distinct fishy taste/smell to it.\\n\\nOverall, although they ran out of salmon, the sushi and sashimi we got were still really good. The waitstaff accommodated to our needs and was nice and helpful. I can see why customers keep coming back to eat!', u'I was craving sushi one night for dinner and found this place on Yelp. I\\'m surprised I haven\\'t heard of this place!\\n\\nOn a Saturday night the wait for two was 30-40 mins. We didn\\'t get a table however, but we were fine sitting at the sushi bar.\\n\\nI love chirashi and after seeing all the pictures on Yelp, I knew I had to order it. What we ordered: uni shooters, an order of sake toro, hamachi toro, and white tuna nigiri, an unagi don, an extra special chirashi, and the tomi special roll. We also ordered the ankimo (monkfish liver) appetizer, but it never came. We were honestly so full from the food that I was a bit grateful they forgot our ankimo. Our dinner also came with complimentary bowls of miso soup. We also received a complimentary side salad which I think came with the unagi don.\\n\\nThe sushi was delicious. The sake toro was definitely very memorable and a must try. The salmon belly was very buttery with fat marbled nicely, tender and just delicious. I\\'ll definitely have to order more of it next time. The other fish were all very fresh and delicious too. The extra special chirashi was amazing as well with a great selection of sashimi. Their uni was also very good, wasn\\'t grainy at all. I think I prefer the uni nigiri over the uni shooters, but that\\'s just my personal preference. I definitely have to try their ankimo next time.\\n\\nTheir prices are on the pricier side for sushi, but it\\'s definitely worth it. Our bill came out to be around $123.\\n\\nService was pretty good. Waitresses are attentive and speedy. However, when I told the waitress that we didn\\'t get the ankimo, she had to confirm with the sushi chefs and the sushi chef told her \"if they say they didn\\'t get it then they didn\\'t get it, just write it off\". I mean this conversation happened in front of us. I found it a bit rude, especially since they sounded like they didn\\'t believe us. I would have still requested it if I was still hungry. But that scene was just baffling.\\n\\nOverall, 4 stars for their sushi, but 2 stars for their service.', u\"Love their lunch specials! $10.95 for a bento boxes with two items (i.e. chicken teriyaki + sashimi) is solid. Fills me up every time and the service is lightning speed. Almost too fast... You will literally get one minute to look at the menu before they come take your order, and if you tell them you're not ready yet, they'll give another one minute. They're so busy and the demand is so high that they kinda want you to eat and leave. Still, I love this place for the high food quality.\\n\\nOn another occasion, I and another person spent $180 before tip on just sashimi. Yeah.... IT ADDS UP, especially if you order all toro..... :D  They have salmon toro, yellowtail toro, and tuna toro. All delicious but expen$$$ive.\\n\\nYou best get there when it opens at 11:30am or it will be hard to get seating!\", u'The actual sushi at Sushi Tomi is absolutely delicious- some of the freshest sashimi I have tried in the Bay Area! Unfortunately, my reasoning for the three stars simply has to do with the organization of the restaurant. For one- it is challenging to phone in an order as the menu online is difficult to navigate. They have several different menus they use at the actual restaurant that are not all posted online. The reason for my frustration is the line to pick up your food at Sushi Tomi is combined with the \"waiting to be seated\" line which is always completely slammed. Also, the area to wait is so small that most people have to wait outside!\\n\\nThree stars until they figure out the organization. Four stars for the actual cuisine. Check out the restaurant and you will see what I\\'m talking about...', u'Sushi Tomi? More like Sushi Tummy. As in, \"get in my tummy, now!\".\\n\\nI ordered the lunch combo ($10.90) which comes with two choices of entree items, salad, rice and miso soup. I opted for teriyaki chicken and teriyaki salmon. The chicken was crispy (mainly due to the skin being left on) and the salmon was flavorful. The sweet teriyaki sauce was quite enjoyable. And bonus points for the hearty miso soup, which came with small tofu cubes and green onion.\\n\\nThe wife ordered the daily special (also $10.90) which was the chirashi bowl with salmon and tuna. The sushi: very fresh. Me: very envious.\\n\\nWe also splurged for an order of salmon avocado rolls and California rolls; each was $6.90 for six pieces, and each was fantastic. I really think we needed at least two more orders of these...\\n\\nThe waitstaff was genuinely friendly with good service to boot. The only bad thing about this place is the long line outside!', u\"Probably my favorite place to get sushi in MV.\\n\\nIt's consistently good, portions are decent, and fish is fresh. It gets packed so make sure you beat the dinner/lunch crowd or you're waiting.\\n\\nI highly recommend getting their sushi plates or their lunch/dinner combos. This place isn't too big on rolls so there's not a lot of options. I love their nigiri combos because it's the perfect amount of food and the fish is fresh and tasty! Their chirashi bowls also look good but that tends to be too much rice for me. Their lunch/dinner combos are actually pretty filling. I usually get the chicken terriyaki in combination with sashimi or spicy tuna roll. Their chicken is grilled just how I like it, which is to the point you can taste that charred/seared portion of the chicken and they don't go super heavy on the sauce which is nice!\\n\\nTheir prices are a higher than other sushi restaurants in the area but worth it if you're a fan of quality fish.\", u\"Yeah, I don't know why people recommend this place to highly. The service staff is lovely, but the sushi chefs are LAZY. Last night, they couldn't even summon the energy to get rice all the way around my rainbow roll. The rice was sorta squished around three-fourths of the circumference with over-mayo'd crab sticking to the plate.\\nTo my utter disappointment, the hotate was prepared with too much wasabi. I like hotate nigiri when it tastes like butter. I should have ordered it sabi-nuki. My nose was on fire.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the spicy tuna roll was excellent.\\n\\nNext time I'll stick to my guns and go to Yakko Sushi up the street. I like that place a lot better, and it's less expensive.\", u\"I can see why Sushi Tomi is a popular place.\\n\\nI enjoyed the sashimi selection which was reasonably priced at $33.  I can find no fault in the freshness of their fish, however, I did find a bone in my salmon!  Chef? please double check next time, nothing turns me off than having to stop chewing midway so I don't stab the roof of my mouth with fish bone.\\n\\nDon't skip the appetizers, it showcases a variety of grilled items which are perfect for sharing! The chicken skin is so good with just the right amount of crispness and the charcoal markings are so tasty.  I'd skip the beef tongue, it is tough and chewy -- I've had better tongue elsewhere (TWSS?)\\n\\nI wouldn't categorize Sushi Tomi as a destination resto, but definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.\", u\"Sashimi had to be doused in wasabi and soy sauce to get rid of the awful fishy flavor! The staff was pretty standard but the food arrive fast. I definitely wouldn't consider this one of the better sushi places in Mountain View!\", u'Came by for dinner the other night and it was impressive.\\n\\nStarted off with the miso soup and it was slightly better than the one on Moorpark, although a tad salty.\\n\\nMoved on to the Unagi Don which had 4 huge pieces of thick cuts of Unagi. The rice was fluffy and flavorful while the Unagi was excellent. There was also a small piece of the egg too! :)\\n\\nService was friendly by the staff.\\n\\n~$24 after tax and tip for dinner.', u'I kind of hate this place (for a few reasons below), yet I\\'ve continued to go back. I\\'ve been coming here on and off for the past 2 years, but it seems like there was some sort of management change in the last year. Not a good one either.\\n\\nWHY I HATE THIS PLACE:\\n- Sushi quality has declined in the past year.\\n- The sushi cuts are getting bigger and bigger, and the knife work is pretty sloppy.\\n- The menu has some authentic dishes, but the execution of these dishes is not (eg, oshitashi, goma ae, is seriously lacking umami). For comparison, the goma ae at Akane in Los Altos is amazing.\\n- Also, the service/atmosphere has become very \"Chinese\", if you know what I mean (with the exception of one nice waitress). More quantity, less quality, and you can feel the difference in the details. I hope I can get a pass on saying this because I\\'m half Chinese / half Japanese.\\n\\nWHY I STILL GO BACK:\\n- It\\'s 3 blocks away.\\n\\nWHY I WON\\'T GO BACK FOR A WHILE:\\n- The last time I came here, the whole place smelled musky and pungently fishy at the same time. Probably just a one-time thing, but really unappetizing.\\n- Kappo Nami Nami!', u\"It seems like I can never get the name right... Tomi Sushi or Sushi Tomi?  In any case, you always know, it's the Japanese restaurants with the mundane names in a small, crowded venue of traditional wooden fixtures that turn out to be the best.\\n\\nThe sashimi quality is probably one of the better ones in Norcal, and they stay true to authenticity--they have good honest maki, not just an entire page of colorful deep-fried piles of sushi swimming in sauce.  \\n\\nWhen at a place with decent sashimi, there is no doubt that the chirashi is a must-try: they have regular, special, and extra special.  Seeing that I am not a fan of fish roe and prefer the basic stuff, I get REGULAR CHIRASHI ($17) and I am ecstatic--chirashis are shrinking in many restaurants into well-manicured little displays of sashimi, but Sushi Tomi gives you a no-frills, no-skimping generous box of sushi rice topped with several thick slices of fish.\\n\\nIf you want something fancier, they do have the TOMI SPECIAL ROLL ($13.40) which is quite delicious.  I think it would have been more delicious if it came with a description.  From my experience, I would describe it as a roll with a choice of spicy tuna, salmon, or hamachi filling, wrapped in slightly burnt rice and topped with seared albacore.  There's a side of spicy orange sauce and a beautiful garnish of onions and sprouts--it has all the elements of modern cuisine, yet it is not overdone and still has the high-quality sashimi.\\n\\nIf raw fish does not fancy you, the entrees are good as well.  CHICKEN TERIYAKI and CALIFORNIA ROLLS don't sound all too exciting, but here it's simple comfort food.\\n\\nLastly, be sure to come for the amazing LUNCH SPECIALS, (secret: even on weekends!)  Many times there is sashimi, the same delicious Tomi Sushi sashimi, made extremely affordable if you don't mind getting the less aesthetic cuts of the odds and ends.\\n\\nThe complimentary hot green tea is quite comforting, especially when served in a classic Tomi Sushi mug.  It's fairly plain an a fairly oldschool shade of pale blue, but it's exactly these quaint little details that give good Japanese restaurants their charm.\", u\"This is a solid and authentic japanese restaurant nestled in mountain view. I don't think too highly of the South Bay in regards to sushi but sushi tomi really surprised me.\\n\\nThings to know:\\n- Arrive upon opening time to avoid waiting in line otherwise come with patience as the lines can get long\\n- Chirashi is really good. I love their rice.. It is some of the best in my opinion\\n- Tomi special roll is an absolute must\", u\"The hype brought me here. I've walked past this restaurant many times and didn't think much of it. It's very unassuming, whole in the wall type. However, considering all the positive reviews we gave it a try.\\n\\nWord is the wait can get quite long, but we came at 815PM on a Sunday evening so it was only ~15 minutes. I ordered the Extra Special Nigiri dinner and my boyfriend ordered the Combination Special: Salmon Teriyaki and Chicken Sukiyaki.\\n\\nHis sukiyaki was good, homestyle-like; nothing fancy and prepared in the kitchen vs at our table. As part of a combination dinner, that's to be expected though. The other dishes were just ok. Boyfriend said salmon was semi-dry and my nigiri was meh. They were out of Sake which wasn't the end of the world so they substituted Hamachi per my request instead. I also got schooled by ordering the Extra Special, but didn't get Toro. Didn't realize until was too late.\\n\\nBottom line: the food fell flat.\", u'I was able to get a table here after an hour or so wait. Sushi Tomi seems to be a more traditional sushi place that focuses more on basic sashimi and rolls instead of the more complex rolls seen at other sushi places.\\n\\nWe ordered the extra special sashimi plate and the regular chirashi bowl. In addition to staples like salmon and regular tuna, the extra special plate has sea snail, uni, ebi, toro, and amberjack. The regular chirashi bowl had more of the standard lineup of fish, but I imagine getting the extra special chirashi would be similar to the extra special sashimi plate.\\n\\nOverall, the fish was very fresh but the 1 hr+ waits (no option for reservation) and the slightly higher price point is something to consider. The wealth of sushi places in the area makes me feel like I could find another place with a shorter wait and lower price even if it is slightly worse in quality. Sushi Tomi is undoubtedly a quality sushi restaurant though and worth a try if you are willing to wait.', u\"The wait is crazy here FYI, but I would say it was worth it! :)\\n\\nChef's Choice Sashimi\\n--The lean tuna and salmon cuts tasted very fresh and the texture was great! I tried Amber Jack for the first time and although it had too strong of a fishy taste, I enjoyed the moderately fatty texture. The toro wasn't my cup of tea but it was fresh nonetheless. I did not like the taste of the Uni and probably will never eat that again (once again my preference and not the way it was prepared). I had the hardest time eating the sea snails because it reminds me of the times I killed snails in my backyard. Anyhow, I like the texture more than the taste or the thought of eating snails. The white fish's texture was in between a crunchy and jelly consistency, which I didn't quite like. The flavor of the fish I didn't particularly enjoy either. I thought overall I experienced a lot of raw seafood and also got to eat fresh, delicious standard cuts like tuna and salmon.\\n\\nExtra Special Chirashi\\n-This had some of the standard sashimi cuts including tuna and salmon. The seaweed and mushrooms on the side were a great addition! The egg was a bit too sweet! The rice was chewy and not too sticky. Yay!\\n\\nI am giving this place a four star because the seafood is very fresh. I would love to come back to try some of the fun appetizers though!\", u\"MMMMMMM!!! SASHIMI LUNCH! SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK!\\n\\nJust writing this is making my mouth water so let's get to it before I ruin my keyboard.\\n\\nAmbiance:  This place is decent sized for Castro but because it's so yummy there will always be a wait at lunch.  Cool and casual, there is nothing to complain about (unless they can expand the place!)\\n\\nService: My service was good even though the place was slammed.  I'm sure they're used to that level of traffic by now.\\n\\nFood: SASHIMI CUTS SO THICK! I ordered the sashimi lunch under recommendation of my waitress and boy am I glad I did!.  They were served at a perfect temperature and I was given a fairly large portion considering the cost of the lunch deal.  The star of the meal was the SALMON! The cut was so fatty the fish had an almost smoky flavor to it even though it was raw.  I can still taste it in my mouth just thinking about it.  I eat a lot of sushi and I've never had salmon so flavorful.  *shudders*\\n\\nWhat else can I say.  Will be back.  Will get salmon again.  Long wait, don't care.\", u\"This place is now my favorite sushi restaurant!\\n\\nEverything we ordered yesterday was delicious!  Simple, yet fresh!\\n\\nSashimi dinner all just melted in the mouth and the fresh oysters were prepared perfectly...I was a very happy customer!\\n\\nWe also ordered the omakase after realizing it was offered from reading the chalk board hanging over the sushi bar.  Next time I am just going for the $38 meal. You get three appetizers and the chef's choices.  Deep fried baby octopus was great! And surprisingly the monk fish liver was one of my favorite things to eat that night!  Nigiri galore!  I want to go back already!  \\n\\nI got there at 6pm yesterday and the wait list already started! When the bar opened I opt for faster seating! Make sure you indicate that table and bar seating is what you would like when writing on the wait list.  I suggest you get there eArly! There's a parking lot across the street and not a far walk from downtown mountain view.  Service is great!  If you haven't given this place a try, make sure it's on your to eat list!\", u\"I've came here many many times with my mom (because she is a baller, and I'm broke cant afford expensive sushi places lol)\\n\\nThe sushi is indeed fresh but bento box are fairly small, last time my salmon teriyaki was incredibly small that i had to order their $17 hamachi sashimi after lol\\n\\nThe bill came out to be $70 for us two, DAYMMM i can eat so much other food with that kind of money lol #collegestudentlife\", u\"I'm not from the area so when I asked my friends where their absolute go to place for sushi is and they highly recommended Sushi Tomi, of course I had to stop by! And boy,  I'm glad I did! I got the extra special nigiri lunch which usually comes with uni but they were out :( Still delicious though!\\n\\nThe place is small and it's street parking but there is a meter lot right across from it! If you're going for lunch, I world say try to get there like 10 mins before opening and you won't have to wait long!\", u\"Catching up with a girlfriend down south after a long day of work. Sudden memory recall. I was often in this part of town in early 90s, at the time, with a boyfriend from Chicago, and we ate nothing but sushi. Terribly short lived romance but excellent meals.\\n\\nGirlfriend and I have known each other for nearly two decades. So happy to see her. We ordered the sashimi combo and grilled squid. Spent a lot of time catching up. Tea was quite nice. The place was exceptionally packed for a Monday evening. I could see why because the fish was quite fresh and clearly it has a following.\\n\\nI know nothing about the south bay any more, but for a place of meet and greet, and grab something decent to eat, and if time is no issue, this is a great place to try your patience. You'd be rewarded, clearly, because the fish is quite good, and there is no shortage of patrons waiting for your seats to allow you to appreciate your good judgment for coming here.\\n\\nThough, having been spoiled rotten in Japan with exceptionally good sushi, and with the handful of sushi joints that continue to wow me elsewhere in the bay area, this place's lackluster performance makes me think one thing and one thing only, there is a definite shortage of really good sushi joints in the south bay, and it's time to head back up the shore.\", u\"Ahhh....nothing like authentic sushi and Japanese dishes. When I am craving for light, clean and crisp flavors, I head on over to good 'ol Sushi Tomi!\\n\\nMy faves:\\n\\nSalmon Ochazuke - light, flavorful, clean.\\nButabara - smaller but chunkier pieces than other izakayas in the Bay (but please know this is not an izakaya restaurant)\\n\\nAnnnnd... I can't remember anymore because I started this review last year and just realized I never posted it. Anyways, just go because this place is way better then others out there. Just expect to get more simple authentic dishes and not GIANT rolls that won't even fit in your mouth.\", u\"Hands down my favorite sushi joint in the area. Super fresh and delicious sushi rolls, sashimi, and hot dishes. Expect a wait during lunch/dinner time - for a reason!\\n\\nToday, me and my high school friend tried the DRAGON ROLL (shrimp tempura, avocado, $11), the SPICY TUNA ($9) - the rice was as very soft and delightful - and the obvious MISO SOUP. They also offer entrees such as Teriyaki Chicken but I haven't tried any of those.\\n\\nYou're guaranteed to get a decent value for your buck - well presented, fresh sushi. Like!\", u\"We came here on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm and ended up waiting about 1.5 hours before getting in. It's a pretty small place, so be prepared to wait for a while.\\n\\nWe ordered the special chirashi, the tomi roll with spicy tuna, salmon toro nigiri, and the katsu don. The special chirashi was really pretty and included a wide assortment of fish and accompaniments. The sashimi here is really fresh, and the salmon was very soft and delicious. The tomi roll was really good as well. The katsu don was pretty bland, so I wouldn't recommend it. The salmon toro was what made our meal though. I've actually never seen salmon toro at a sushi place, and now I wish every restaurant offered it. The salmon was so buttery and melt-in-your-mouth! I'd come back just for the salmon toro.\", u\"Why this place is so popular remains a mystery to me. I can instantly name so many alternatives that are far superior...\\n\\nWe came here on a Sunday for lunch, and waited quite a while to be seated. We had justifiably high expectations, but honestly its food didn't live up to the hype, and the price point is too high for the portion and the quality.\\n\\nI judge my Japanese place by its mackerel, so of course, I got a mackerel lunch special. I was underwhelmed. The fish was over salted and not grilled enough to render the fat. This is an instant turn-off for me, as an authentic japanese restaurant would know how to grill its mackerel to perfection like no others. Further, the fish was not offered as a whole, but in two awkwardly short chunky pieces. This is so far the least impressive mackerel I have had in the south bay. The pork tonkatsu was just okey, a bit over fried.\\n\\nHusband and friend got chirashi bowls. The sashimi/rice potion is really off. There was A LOT of rice yet very little fish. You can see half of the bowl is occupied by lettuce leaves! The fish selection does not live up to its price. For $28, you get 2 measly slices of tuna and 1 slice of salmon--and yet they are not even the good cuts--and lots of lettuce and meaningless fillers for the empty space. This is really disappointing.\\n\\nSome reviews suggest (without verification) that the fish was from Japan... So what? If it is not fatty, buttery, melting, and heavenly like it should be, do I really care if it is from Japan or Jamaica? Does the port of export really equate high quality? Me think not...\\n\\nService is friendly but the entire time we felt rushed.\\n\\nSo... overall I haven't warmed up to Sushi Tomi because of the poor value and the surprisingly unsatisfactory food. Back to Japantown...\", u'This has become one of my favorite places for fresh fish and sushi. If it wasn\\'t so far, I\\'d probably be here everyday and living on the streets cause I couldn\\'t pay rent.\\n\\nThe fish here is extremely fresh and delicious. I don\\'t really get anything else. Chriashi bowls, sake bowls, hamachi kama, and other sushi or sashimi items are my go-tos. Plus they have my absolute favorite fish/cut here: sake toro AKA fatty salmon. Aww yeah!\\n\\nThe service is the reason I\\'m knocking off one star. The chefs seem okay, nothing special. But the servers are usually pretty cold and our waters are usually pretty low. They\\'ll lie about the wait time and I\\'ve watched them tell multiple parties that the wait time is \"30 minutes\", no matter how long the list is.\\n\\nAnyways... fish. Fresh fish. I\\'m down.', u'we went in a group of six and was very satisfied with the service...\\nnigiri lunch set was great and mini chirashi don is also awesome\\n\\ni had the tsukiji sashimi and am glad that it was wayyyy better than sashimi lunch i had last time', u\"I have to say that is one of a very few sushi places that the quality of the food is worth waiting for.  There are not many sushi places that a run by a Japanese owner, not that it matters. But the quality shows and the food taste fresh. Especially if you like raw fish.  The quality of the fish is high grade thus the higher prices.  But it's worth a try.  \\nOnly thing lacking in this place is customer service.  It's so busy with very little help,  it's hard to flag down the waiter.  Once they drop off your food, your on your own until the check arrives.\", u\"Was craving sushi and trusted the high reviews on Yelp.\\n\\nIt was after work and I was starved. I came here wanting something super filling and satisfying but was kind of disappointed. Service took a bit of time, maybe each minute was further exaggerated by my hunger but I was getting kind of pissy.\\n\\nThen the food finally came and made everything better. I got the tomi special roll while the bf got the chirashi. I felt like all of the portions were kind of small or maybe I was just really hungry. The roll was nicely plated and came with a drizzle of sriracha mayo, which was a nice touch. The chirashi only came with 7 pieces of fish and a few pieces of other fillers. After devouring my roll, I was hungry enough to go down the street and devour a sandwich.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, everything tasted great and was of good quality. I just felt like I spent a little much for barely putting a dent on my hunger pangs.\", u\"After moving from San Jose to Sunnyvale, I had to look for another sushi joint as Cha Cha Sushi (my fave sushi restaurant) was just too far. After browsing through yelp, trying some sushi places nearby, I finally found this gem. Every time I go it's always busy and there's always a wait. Even at 8pm! I still think it's worth the wait though as I've never had to wait longer than 30 mins. The workers here are very nice. The place is pretty small and the decor is just okay.  \\nI've tried a few nigiris, rolls, hand rolls, and all were pretty good. The sashimi was very fresh but the size varies. The first time I went they ran out of oysters, but the second time I was able to order some.. boy were they delicious! Very fresh and tasty. This isn't the best sushi joint I've been to, but it is the best I've found in this area so far. Will be coming back :-)\", u'I really liked the sushi here. However, I docked a star because of the long wait- my friend and I waited for 45 minutes for a seat Friday around 8PM. When you walk in, you immediately see the sushi bar seating in front of the very pro sushi chefs, who are busy prepping for meals and slicing the fish in the oh-so-fine way. There are seats at the bar, as well as a some in the adjacent room. The space is very limited. Just walking through to our seats, we had trouble maneuvering past the chairs and tables. There were wooden booths/benches on the wall, but we were seated right next to the kitchen, which was distracting. The waiter was prompt to give us tea and take our order, but they ran out of specific items, like the gyoza.\\n\\nWe ordered the agedashi tofu, tomi roll, spicy tuna roll, and unagi don. I really enjoyed the tomi roll, the raw fish tasted fresh and fatty, and it worked nicely with the avocado.  The  sauce had a kick to it and the thinly sliced red raw onions added another dimension to the roll. I\\'ve never had a roll prepared like this before. Really interesting. The spicy tuna roll was good. It had a higher salt content than I would have like, but the \"spicy\" flavor was definitely there. I was disappointed with the agedashi tofu, because I\\'ve had a lot better, the tempura skin seemed to kind of melt off TOO easily. The unagi don was not good. The unagi was overcooked and too chewy.\\n\\nService was good and prompt.', u\"Ok so, I love sushi as much as anyone on Yelp would.\\n\\nI could go as far to say that, I've been fortunate to try a wide spectrum of it (haven't been to Tsukiji, Jiro's, or Urasawa), but I believe I got a good understanding of quality when it comes to the good stuff.\\n\\nSushi Tomi, for me would be on the medium to almost high-premium end, depending on what you purchase.\\n\\nWe got the following items:\\n\\nOmakase 10 piece (no appetizers) w/ added fresh wasabi: (instagram.com/p/1uEm5bnh\\u2026)\\nChiraishi Bowl: (instagram.com/p/1uEaylnh\\u2026)\\nChu Toro and Scallops (instagram.com/p/1uD4tpnh\\u2026)\\nTomi Special Roll: instagram.com/p/1uE5uWHh\\u2026)\\n\\nThe Omakase was fresh, everything showcased what a traditional (and authentic) Japanese Sushi spot in America, should follow suit by. A range of tangy, salty, sweet, and savory all at once. The biggest mistake was forgetting to add the fresh wasabi. I felt stupid, think they would put it on the board instead of misplacing it last minute.\\n\\nChiraishi Bowl was deemed tasty to the lady so no complaints there, didn't really try so can't compliment.\\n\\nChu Toro and Scallops were fresh and on point. Was hoping for Ootoro, but beggars can't be choosers when there's no supply.\\n\\nThe best item, is their specialty roll, the Tomi, wrapped in seared salmon and scallops is not only affordable ($14.00/pp order) but very filling. If I wasn't curious for the Omakase, I would've ordered four of these rolls instead. You can customize the inside components, but the outside remains the same. The sauce is the standard spicy sushi roll but the savory and sweetness blends really well for this particular roll. Nothing like it anywhere in the entire Bay Area (or South Bay even)\\n\\nOverall, customer service was nice and seating was a bit cramped. It took a while to get orders 20-25 minutes and you're bound to wait at least 25 minutes outside (at peak service hours).\\n\\nI'll rate this a 3.5 but bumped up to a 4, due to reasonable sushi prices, that would almost rival one of my favorite spots (Tekka Japanese Restaurant, San Francisco, CA; Inner Richmond).\", u\"Word of Warning: If you're looking for a diabetes inducing, ooey gooey roll with an endless drizzle of kabayaki sauce, you would be better served by going to a Mizu or Kenji. However, if you're looking for a no nonsense traditional sushi restaurant where most of the staff are actually Japanese, then I suggest you give Sushi Tomi a roll.\\n\\nNestled on a dark quiet side street off Castro St(which represents downtown Mountain View), the first two things you will probably notice, when arriving during dinner time, is there will inevitably be a few bodies huddled on the dark sidewalk with interesting shadows created by the light breaking through the window. Once you're seated you will notice the tightly spaced light colored wooden furniture throughout, accentuated by the bright overhead lighting.\\n\\nI was pleased with the Tako and Unagi(fresher than most) Nigiri, and the grilled whole squid which had a nice consistency(not over cooked) and produced a pleasant slightly smoky taste. The Sashimi dinner had thick,sizable, even cuts(even though a number of reviewers have complained about the amateur cutting they're experienced here recently).\\n\\nIn my opinion, Sushi Tomi represents a fair value for what they serve and when I'm in the area this is still one of my favorite Sushi restaurants.\", u\"Sushi is on point, especially the sashimi.\\n\\nOverall good, but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I would've given this place 5 solid stars. Came on a Wednesday night at around 6pm, and the wait was around 15 minutes! Not sure how long the weekend would be...\\n\\nOrdered:\\nExtra Special Sashimi: 4/5 fresh, delicious\\nTomi Special Roll: 4/5 delicious as well\", u\"Decided to give this place a shot based upon the fact that it is highly rated and has the most reviews of any sushi spot in Mountain View. Since we were in the city of Mountain View, we went for it.\\n\\nI was a bit let down. There are plenty and I mean plenty of places better than this spot for sushi/Japanese food in the bay area. First, there is a decent wait. When you're the best reviewed sushi spot  in Mountain View, you're going to get people driving in droves to visit.\\n\\nTheir actual sushi menu is a bit on the limited side. They have the fundamentals, but in this day and age, we are above the expected. It's the unexpected that has everyone jumping for joy in the streets. Their rolls are also a bit on the smaller side. However, I can't complain for the taste. All the rolls tasted fresh, and in essence, that's pretty darn important.\\n\\nThe service was kinda weird. They started off fast and efficient and then began to drag their feet. The food came in bursts, rather than a unified whole. My cousin had to wait 10 extra minutes for his grilled squid after we all got our food.\\n\\nOverall, this place is nothing special. In a region where sushi spots are all over the place, there are many better alternates.\", u'Pricing: Good-Expensive. Really up there, but it\\'s sashimi after all.\\nQuality: Good. Fresh, but I have had fresher.\\nTurnaround: Good. We had to wait in the cold, but we managed.\\nService: Good-Excellent. Our server accommodated us by replacing uni with other sashimi.\\n\\nWe ordered the chirashi, which comes in several \"tiers\" of quality depending on the type sashimi and possibly in amount too beginning at $14.00. We ordered the $19.00 for the toro option and I was a little surprised at the small amount of sashimi over rice we received. However, our server was nice in letting the kitchen know to replace the uni with other types of sashimi since we never acquired a taste for urchin. This would mean a cheaper meal for them to make so of course they would do it. Although marbled, the toro was not as smooth as I expected and the pricing is comparable to a very fresh sashimi restaurant I been to in San Francisco where the sashimi was so fresh, they almost tasted sweet. However, the fish here is fresh and still of excellent quality though not as high as I expected so no real complaints there. There was a wait when we arrived and because of the small restaurant, we had wait out in the cold. Luckily, there was a group of us so we huddled and managed to survive until they called our name.', u'Overall best sushi in mountain view Castro St.! Super reasonable pricing for quality and legit tasting authentic Japanese food. All sushi chefs appear to be from Japan. Staff is attentive even though the lunch rush is epic! Get there early as tables fill endlessly and a line and wait surely will await for you!\\n\\nSome memorable moments include: hamachi toro, toro, and uni all imported and on point especially in price!', u'Solid sushi joint in downtown Mountain View! It\\'s a pretty small restaurant, nothing fancy, and seems relatively busy during lunch (at the very least), but the wait wasn\\'t more than 10 minutes around 1pm for a table for 2.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty simple: mostly bento boxes, noodles, sashimi and sushi. It\\'s not one of those sushi places you\\'d go to for those fancy, creative rolls. Food came out pretty quickly, but I was surprised they didn\\'t automatically give us or at least offer water.\\n\\n====================\\n\\nI ordered:\\n\\nREGULAR CHIRASHI ($17) - 4.5/5\\nCame with miso soup. I thought the bowl was very reasonably priced for the portion size. It came with 2 pieces of salmon, 2 tuna, 1 yellowtail, 1 white fish, 1 shrimp, 1 surf clam, 1 tamago, 2 fish cakes, some veggies (cucumber, seaweed and something else) and a huge portion of sushi rice. And the sashimi were thick cuts! All pretty fresh but a slice or two were still on the cold side. The texture of the sashimi was soft for the most part, but not quite the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth kind of sashimi. One of the slices of tuna was kind of stringy and \"gamey\" though, but overall, very solid and definitely worth the price. I really liked the tamago/egg too!', u\"Discovered this place when my friends and I had a fail attempt to go to Crepevine in downtown Mountain View earlier to have some late lunch. So I've searched for other places that had at least 4 yelp stars with lots of reviews and found Sushi Tomi. We parked where the nearby garage is at so it was a bit far but we didn't mind the walk since it was a nice stroll along downtown.\\n\\nI got to the bento box - chicken teriyaki, saba, sashimi and tempura. It was delicious. I never really had an idea what the hell saba was until my food arrived; it was just a grilled fish and you put some lemon and salt if you wish or just eat it without it. I had three huge pieces Tuna sashimi and I was surprised how thick the cut was. Usually, sushi places will serve you about 4-5 sashimi pieces but they area tiny portion.\\n\\nService was good as well. Our waitress checked up on us from time to time to see if we needed something else - mostly refill of water and extra napkins.\\n\\nThis is definitely my go-to spot in downtown Mountain View if I want something affordable and yummy!\", u'I came here again and I was so... underwhelmed... I ordered the Tomi Special roll again, and they BARELY gave me any seared salmon! It was strange. And, the salmon sashimi was not as yummy as I remembered it being. I was extremely underwhelmed.\\n\\nMaybe my review will change again in the future.... but for now.............. I vant to geev u 3 stars, but the waiters are so nice and friendly here you get an extra +bump for that :D woot woot', u'soooo my cousin, Jennifer Y. is completely addicted to this place. She raves about this PLACE ALL THE TIME. so of course one of the days my other cousin from canada flew in, we had to try this place out. We came after work so around 830, the wait was about 15-20 min AND THEY RAN OUT OF SALMONNN  ): ):\\n\\nThe restaurant is an average size, but it looks small and crowded bc the tables are kinda close together to they try and fit more people. We were helped right away with tea and water. We ordered a few rolls and 1-2 huge plates of sashimi. Everything was super good! I remember we got the sushi tomi roll, which was delicious. The fatty tuna (toro) was to DIE FORRR!!! omgg it was sooo buttery and just melted in my mouth. Really made me appreciate the different kinds of sashimi more. They also had UNI!! It was my first time trying and we were given a small portion on our sashimi plate. Kinda smushy but i liked it! My cousin didnt because the piece he got still had a slight distinct fishy taste/smell to it.\\n\\nOverall, although they ran out of salmon, the sushi and sashimi we got were still really good. The waitstaff accommodated to our needs and was nice and helpful. I can see why customers keep coming back to eat!', u'I was craving sushi one night for dinner and found this place on Yelp. I\\'m surprised I haven\\'t heard of this place!\\n\\nOn a Saturday night the wait for two was 30-40 mins. We didn\\'t get a table however, but we were fine sitting at the sushi bar.\\n\\nI love chirashi and after seeing all the pictures on Yelp, I knew I had to order it. What we ordered: uni shooters, an order of sake toro, hamachi toro, and white tuna nigiri, an unagi don, an extra special chirashi, and the tomi special roll. We also ordered the ankimo (monkfish liver) appetizer, but it never came. We were honestly so full from the food that I was a bit grateful they forgot our ankimo. Our dinner also came with complimentary bowls of miso soup. We also received a complimentary side salad which I think came with the unagi don.\\n\\nThe sushi was delicious. The sake toro was definitely very memorable and a must try. The salmon belly was very buttery with fat marbled nicely, tender and just delicious. I\\'ll definitely have to order more of it next time. The other fish were all very fresh and delicious too. The extra special chirashi was amazing as well with a great selection of sashimi. Their uni was also very good, wasn\\'t grainy at all. I think I prefer the uni nigiri over the uni shooters, but that\\'s just my personal preference. I definitely have to try their ankimo next time.\\n\\nTheir prices are on the pricier side for sushi, but it\\'s definitely worth it. Our bill came out to be around $123.\\n\\nService was pretty good. Waitresses are attentive and speedy. However, when I told the waitress that we didn\\'t get the ankimo, she had to confirm with the sushi chefs and the sushi chef told her \"if they say they didn\\'t get it then they didn\\'t get it, just write it off\". I mean this conversation happened in front of us. I found it a bit rude, especially since they sounded like they didn\\'t believe us. I would have still requested it if I was still hungry. But that scene was just baffling.\\n\\nOverall, 4 stars for their sushi, but 2 stars for their service.', u\"Love their lunch specials! $10.95 for a bento boxes with two items (i.e. chicken teriyaki + sashimi) is solid. Fills me up every time and the service is lightning speed. Almost too fast... You will literally get one minute to look at the menu before they come take your order, and if you tell them you're not ready yet, they'll give another one minute. They're so busy and the demand is so high that they kinda want you to eat and leave. Still, I love this place for the high food quality.\\n\\nOn another occasion, I and another person spent $180 before tip on just sashimi. Yeah.... IT ADDS UP, especially if you order all toro..... :D  They have salmon toro, yellowtail toro, and tuna toro. All delicious but expen$$$ive.\\n\\nYou best get there when it opens at 11:30am or it will be hard to get seating!\", u'The actual sushi at Sushi Tomi is absolutely delicious- some of the freshest sashimi I have tried in the Bay Area! Unfortunately, my reasoning for the three stars simply has to do with the organization of the restaurant. For one- it is challenging to phone in an order as the menu online is difficult to navigate. They have several different menus they use at the actual restaurant that are not all posted online. The reason for my frustration is the line to pick up your food at Sushi Tomi is combined with the \"waiting to be seated\" line which is always completely slammed. Also, the area to wait is so small that most people have to wait outside!\\n\\nThree stars until they figure out the organization. Four stars for the actual cuisine. Check out the restaurant and you will see what I\\'m talking about...', u'Sushi Tomi? More like Sushi Tummy. As in, \"get in my tummy, now!\".\\n\\nI ordered the lunch combo ($10.90) which comes with two choices of entree items, salad, rice and miso soup. I opted for teriyaki chicken and teriyaki salmon. The chicken was crispy (mainly due to the skin being left on) and the salmon was flavorful. The sweet teriyaki sauce was quite enjoyable. And bonus points for the hearty miso soup, which came with small tofu cubes and green onion.\\n\\nThe wife ordered the daily special (also $10.90) which was the chirashi bowl with salmon and tuna. The sushi: very fresh. Me: very envious.\\n\\nWe also splurged for an order of salmon avocado rolls and California rolls; each was $6.90 for six pieces, and each was fantastic. I really think we needed at least two more orders of these...\\n\\nThe waitstaff was genuinely friendly with good service to boot. The only bad thing about this place is the long line outside!', u\"Probably my favorite place to get sushi in MV.\\n\\nIt's consistently good, portions are decent, and fish is fresh. It gets packed so make sure you beat the dinner/lunch crowd or you're waiting.\\n\\nI highly recommend getting their sushi plates or their lunch/dinner combos. This place isn't too big on rolls so there's not a lot of options. I love their nigiri combos because it's the perfect amount of food and the fish is fresh and tasty! Their chirashi bowls also look good but that tends to be too much rice for me. Their lunch/dinner combos are actually pretty filling. I usually get the chicken terriyaki in combination with sashimi or spicy tuna roll. Their chicken is grilled just how I like it, which is to the point you can taste that charred/seared portion of the chicken and they don't go super heavy on the sauce which is nice!\\n\\nTheir prices are a higher than other sushi restaurants in the area but worth it if you're a fan of quality fish.\", u\"Yeah, I don't know why people recommend this place to highly. The service staff is lovely, but the sushi chefs are LAZY. Last night, they couldn't even summon the energy to get rice all the way around my rainbow roll. The rice was sorta squished around three-fourths of the circumference with over-mayo'd crab sticking to the plate.\\nTo my utter disappointment, the hotate was prepared with too much wasabi. I like hotate nigiri when it tastes like butter. I should have ordered it sabi-nuki. My nose was on fire.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the spicy tuna roll was excellent.\\n\\nNext time I'll stick to my guns and go to Yakko Sushi up the street. I like that place a lot better, and it's less expensive.\", u\"I can see why Sushi Tomi is a popular place.\\n\\nI enjoyed the sashimi selection which was reasonably priced at $33.  I can find no fault in the freshness of their fish, however, I did find a bone in my salmon!  Chef? please double check next time, nothing turns me off than having to stop chewing midway so I don't stab the roof of my mouth with fish bone.\\n\\nDon't skip the appetizers, it showcases a variety of grilled items which are perfect for sharing! The chicken skin is so good with just the right amount of crispness and the charcoal markings are so tasty.  I'd skip the beef tongue, it is tough and chewy -- I've had better tongue elsewhere (TWSS?)\\n\\nI wouldn't categorize Sushi Tomi as a destination resto, but definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.\", u\"Sashimi had to be doused in wasabi and soy sauce to get rid of the awful fishy flavor! The staff was pretty standard but the food arrive fast. I definitely wouldn't consider this one of the better sushi places in Mountain View!\", u'Came by for dinner the other night and it was impressive.\\n\\nStarted off with the miso soup and it was slightly better than the one on Moorpark, although a tad salty.\\n\\nMoved on to the Unagi Don which had 4 huge pieces of thick cuts of Unagi. The rice was fluffy and flavorful while the Unagi was excellent. There was also a small piece of the egg too! :)\\n\\nService was friendly by the staff.\\n\\n~$24 after tax and tip for dinner.', u'I kind of hate this place (for a few reasons below), yet I\\'ve continued to go back. I\\'ve been coming here on and off for the past 2 years, but it seems like there was some sort of management change in the last year. Not a good one either.\\n\\nWHY I HATE THIS PLACE:\\n- Sushi quality has declined in the past year.\\n- The sushi cuts are getting bigger and bigger, and the knife work is pretty sloppy.\\n- The menu has some authentic dishes, but the execution of these dishes is not (eg, oshitashi, goma ae, is seriously lacking umami). For comparison, the goma ae at Akane in Los Altos is amazing.\\n- Also, the service/atmosphere has become very \"Chinese\", if you know what I mean (with the exception of one nice waitress). More quantity, less quality, and you can feel the difference in the details. I hope I can get a pass on saying this because I\\'m half Chinese / half Japanese.\\n\\nWHY I STILL GO BACK:\\n- It\\'s 3 blocks away.\\n\\nWHY I WON\\'T GO BACK FOR A WHILE:\\n- The last time I came here, the whole place smelled musky and pungently fishy at the same time. Probably just a one-time thing, but really unappetizing.\\n- Kappo Nami Nami!', u\"It seems like I can never get the name right... Tomi Sushi or Sushi Tomi?  In any case, you always know, it's the Japanese restaurants with the mundane names in a small, crowded venue of traditional wooden fixtures that turn out to be the best.\\n\\nThe sashimi quality is probably one of the better ones in Norcal, and they stay true to authenticity--they have good honest maki, not just an entire page of colorful deep-fried piles of sushi swimming in sauce.  \\n\\nWhen at a place with decent sashimi, there is no doubt that the chirashi is a must-try: they have regular, special, and extra special.  Seeing that I am not a fan of fish roe and prefer the basic stuff, I get REGULAR CHIRASHI ($17) and I am ecstatic--chirashis are shrinking in many restaurants into well-manicured little displays of sashimi, but Sushi Tomi gives you a no-frills, no-skimping generous box of sushi rice topped with several thick slices of fish.\\n\\nIf you want something fancier, they do have the TOMI SPECIAL ROLL ($13.40) which is quite delicious.  I think it would have been more delicious if it came with a description.  From my experience, I would describe it as a roll with a choice of spicy tuna, salmon, or hamachi filling, wrapped in slightly burnt rice and topped with seared albacore.  There's a side of spicy orange sauce and a beautiful garnish of onions and sprouts--it has all the elements of modern cuisine, yet it is not overdone and still has the high-quality sashimi.\\n\\nIf raw fish does not fancy you, the entrees are good as well.  CHICKEN TERIYAKI and CALIFORNIA ROLLS don't sound all too exciting, but here it's simple comfort food.\\n\\nLastly, be sure to come for the amazing LUNCH SPECIALS, (secret: even on weekends!)  Many times there is sashimi, the same delicious Tomi Sushi sashimi, made extremely affordable if you don't mind getting the less aesthetic cuts of the odds and ends.\\n\\nThe complimentary hot green tea is quite comforting, especially when served in a classic Tomi Sushi mug.  It's fairly plain an a fairly oldschool shade of pale blue, but it's exactly these quaint little details that give good Japanese restaurants their charm.\"]"

My recommendations:\\n\\nDried Bamboo Shoots with (Fatty) Pork\\nHot and Sour Soup\\nDuck Stew Napa Cabbage\\nShanghai Style Pork Knuckle\\nFish Fillet with Wine Sauce\\n\\nThe steam pork buns have thick skin and so do the fried buns. I'll eagerly await the grand opening of Din Tai Feng.\", u\"Not bad, but only if you have plenty of time to kill.  \\n\\nThis place is a moderately sized sit-in restaurant located in a surprisingly shady looking shopping center in Mountain View.  There is a ton of parking and it's conveniently located right on Rengstorff, a couple minutes off the 101 exit.  The interior is not much to look at and the decor is minimal.  I came before lunchtime (11:20ish?) on a weekday and it was nearly dead empty (around lunchtime, a couple other tables filled up).  \\n\\nThe three dishes we had were pretty good overall.  The soup dumplings (quantity of 6) had a thin skin that was surprisingly resilient to the flavorful pork and crab soup filling -- one of the better ones I've had so far living on the peninsula.  We also had the sheng jian bao (fried pork buns) and they were quite good, juice on the inside and just the right amount of flavorful (however, it will take 20 minutes for it to come out so order early).  The stir fried rice cake with preserved vegetable and pork was only ok and the serving was small to average.  \\n\\nMy main gripe with this place was the slow service, despite it being an unusual mealtime.  It looked like it was being manned by just 2 people, who were overseeing the kitchen and also taking orders AND also handling take-out pickup.  While I was seated immediately (and that shouldn't be surprising, given that the restaurant was empty), my order wasn't taken for nearly half an hour while the woman at the register was bombarded by one take-out pickup after another, and the other worker was dashing in and out of the kitchen.  I also saw them putting the buns together from scratch after each order was put in, which is certainly nice but as expected, all of this took some time.  \\n\\nOverall, the food is fairly good and Mtn View has been a bit of a black hole when it comes to good Chinese food, in my opinion, especially with Sunnyvale and San Mateo nearby.  But just don't expect to get in and out in a short time frame, even on a weekday.\", u\"My review is based on trying one dish, chow mein, which is my litmus test at a Chinese restaurant.  It was very bland.  The noodles were mushy and despite being very brown, like it was covered in sauce, it was very bland.  All the meats were overly tenderized and the shrimp was not so fresh tasting.\\n\\nThere really isn't much service required but one of the two servers was really nice.\\n\\nI love noodles and since this place failed on that, I won't be back.\", u\"I would say that this place is 3.5 stars.\\n\\nI came here for lunch after church service on Sunday. Prices are decent and there is a wide selection. The XLB are good and the wrappers are thin, but I've had better in SoCal at Din Tai Fung, Dumpling House, and Mama Lu's. The Jia jia mian was pretty good. We also ordered salt and pepper fish, although it was kinda bland and not spicy compared to other restaurants such as New Port. They were very busy, so service was slow, but overall ok experience. Typical, average chinese food.\", u\"4 stars for the xiao long bao! Thin skins that don't break, gingery pork filling, soft crab filling, and delicious soup inside! Perfect ginger vinegar dipping sauce too. I've been searching for good xlb from Cupertino to San Francisco, and I haven't found a place that beats this yet.\\n\\nStandard authentic Chinese restaurant service (read: not very good service). The Shanghai cakes are also pretty good, as is the pork cooked in bamboo. But the best thing about Bamboo Garden is definitely their xlb.\", u'Great Xiao Long Bao. Pork knuckle is huge and tender. Owner is friendly and service is quick', u\"Some friends of ours are regular customers to this place.  Because they have a young baby, we offered to pick up dinner and bring it over to their place.  They placed the order.  When we arrived, we picked up dinner for 4, which was a pretty large order.  The door clearly states that they accept credit cards, but the woman would not let me pay in anything but cash.  She said that we got some special that requires paying in cash.  Pretty annoying.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a strip mall off of Central Expressway with Shell Gas Station on the corner.  The dining room was very basic, definitely not upscale and definitely no ambiance.  It was functional.  A bunch of large round tables might be good for groups.\\n\\nI found the food a bit too greasy and not that flavorful.  The meat also didn't taste very fresh to me.  My Chinese friend who ordered says this place is authentic, and all the people eating inside the restaurant were Chinese, so maybe this is just how legitimate Chinese food tastes.  For context, I am Asian and have had tons of Asian food all my life.  So maybe this is just how un-fresh un-flavorful legitimate Chinese food tastes.  :P\\n\\nI would only eat here again if the same friends wanted us to pick it up and bring it over for them because they have a young baby.\", u'This place is so good that I almost don\\'t want to review it out of fear that it will get popular and crowded.  The food is simply amazing.  Like other posters said, you must get xiao long bao (\"steamed dumplings\" on the menu).  But I\\'ve been many times and never had a bad dish, so try anything.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit of a hole in the wall and usually not too busy.  The staff is friendly and actually remembers us, which is nice.  Feels very homey.  Love this place.', u'Top notch XLB! So soupy and such delicate skins! Service so kind. Greens tasted so fresh and clean. Green onion pancakes and wonton soup all excellent as well. Wish this was our local spot and not 100 miles from my house!', u\"The XLB is still amazing (see my previous extensive review) and I wanted to give a shout out to their vegetable dumplings, oh that delicate skin!\\n\\nI noticed Kathleen (co-owner) wasn't looking as happy as I knew her to be in years past. Actually, she looked chronically stressed. Gotta remember to check-in on the well-being people who have been working day after day to bring us such amazing dumplings.\", u'A family-owned restaurant in a small mall that Packs a Punch!\\n\\nWhen I first walked in, the place didn\\'t look impressive. Boy was I wrong! Once our food arrived, it was insanely good. The juicy pork bun was at just the right temperature, not too hot and not too cold, with lots of juice still inside.\\n\\nWe saw the other tables in the restaurant order the \"bamboo\" rice thing and followed suit--score! The server literally cracks open the bamboo on the table in front of you, and you can see the steam coming out while the juicy goodness flows out onto the plate. Best order decision eva\\n\\nNo wonder this place was so packed!', u'When I am craving for Chinese food, this place is always my number one choice. I like the fish filets in hot chili and the sticky rice with pork belly, so good!', u'XLB would eat again. Affordable with crab.\\nMa poo lunch special can be skipped. Sauce is oily.\\nPan fried pork dumpling is pan fried XLB. Filling and fun texture.\\nVery reasonably priced.', u\"Pros:\\n- fantastic XLB\\n- good Chinese donuts + dipping milk (soymilk)\\n- I confirmed with them that they use no MSG (it's a good sign that I didn't get any MSG side-effects afterwards either)\\n- staff was very helpful in suggesting items\\n- clean place\\n\\nCons:\\n- limit of exactly 1 credit card per table\\n- the suggested items are more traditional, and may not suit American (or Chinese-American) palates well\\n\\nOther notes:\\n- it tastes like they may use soybean oil -- if you are allergic to soy, you should definitely ask them about it before eating!\", u\"I saw the Michelin recommended sheet on the other side of the restaurant, so I had hopes (plus my friends really like this place), but eh, I think it was just ok.\\n\\nWe ordered shanghai rice cakes, 2 steamers of xlb (6 in each), pork belly/bamboo/sticky rice, and a stir fried veggie. Nothing spectacular, the XLB in particular were really unremarkable. I wouldn't be able to describe it to you one week later.\\n\\nWe finished everything but a few bites (how un-Asian!) - total for four of us was around $60 after tax and tip. I'd rather go to Shanghai Dumpling - slightly better food and more spacious restaurant, plus it's a few miles closer to my apartment.\", u\"I'm native Chinese and this place sucks. Ordered ShengJianBao and I thought they forgot to put fillings inside. Completely disappointed at the dishes. No flavors and taste cheap! Not an authentic Shanghai restaurant at all. No wonder they were empty around noon on a Saturday.\", u\"Crab paste xlb - their xlb is pretty solid. Good skin. Doesn't compare to Din tai fung though. I would get the non crab paste one next time. Didn't really enjoy the crab paste\\n\\nSi gua with pork and vermicelli - very bland, pork not good, wouldn't get again\\n\\nBamboo sticky rice pork belly - tasty but too oily for me. Wouldn't get again but is worth trying if you don't mind the oiliness.\\n\\nTofu skin with pork (house special) - bland and the pork was terrible\\n\\nSpring onion pancake - not oily, very normal. Prob wouldn't get again.\\n\\nI may come back one more time when I'm feeling xlb\", u'My most frequent experience of xiao long bao was from Din Tai Fung, so it has been really hard to find decent XLB in the bay area. Finally Bamboo Garden is one place that makes a decent dumpling! You can see them making it in the back behind a window! Good prices too. The xiao long bao are good; the shen jian bao were just so so...a bit too bread-y and doughy for my liking compared to Shanghai Flavor Shop.\\n\\nThe place is a bit small so trying to go out to eat with our young kid or a large group can be hit or miss.', u'I am a semi-regular to this restaurant. The food is usually very homey. They seem to use very little MSG and oil which is rare for Chinese restaurants.\\n\\nThe Shanghai Dumplings are a must. The owner makes them after you order. The dumplings are soupy with just the right proportion of meat and a very delicate dumpling skin. Most importantly, the dumplings were not greasy like in most dim sum places.\\n\\nI also ordered the Bacon Fried Rice and the Fish with Wine Sauce.  The bacon fried rice has a lot of Chinese vegetables in it, making it a well balanced dish even though the rice and bacon are greasy. The dish more accurately resembles a clay pot rice dish, not so much a fried rice dish. The fish with wine sauce is a light and mild dish. The fish is tenderly cooked with beans and Chinese fungus, it provided a perfect compliment to the greasy fried rice that we ordered.\\n\\nThe restaurant is your typical Chinese restaurant with a small window for dumpling watching. The staff is extremely kind for a Chinese restaurant and the owner is a sweetheart that will give you recommendations if asked.\\n\\nThis is a nice and healthy homey place to eat. It is great if you want a nice dinner for yourself or take out as well. It is also extremely family friendly but I would not recommend it for atmosphere or dates.', u\"I've had it with this place. It's not the food that I want to complain about, it's their service, it's just horrendous.\\n\\nThey are so cheap.  I ordered $50 of food for 2 people, I asked for to go boxes, two of the dishes had soup in it.  She (the co-owner of the restaurant) first gave me two paper boxes, I said the soup will leak from the paper boxes, then she gave me one small plastic container, which doesn't even fit all the leftover we had.  She said the other dish would be fine in the paper box.  After we got home, everything was leaking, making a mess in our car.\\n\\nThis time I ordered their soup dumplings to go.  I should've checked before I left but I decided to trust that everything is in the bag. She packed only one piece of napkin and one pair of ragged chopsticks in there, no spoons. Everyone knows you need to eat the soup dumpling with a spoon. I ate mine without a spoon, everything was leaking and falling out when I take a small bite, food dropping into the vinegar container and splashing grease and vinegar everywhere.  All I needed was a plastic spoon!!\\n\\nC'mon!  How cheap can you be?  Can't even spare a plastic spoon for takeout???\\n\\nAlso, she demands payment in cash for anything under $25, what an unreasonable request.\\n\\nTheir food is okay, but because they constantly trying to cheap me out, I will not want to spend a dime there anymore.\", u'Soup dumplings were great. Upon arrival I wondered what else was good here. The answer is nothing (based on what we ordered). I got the salt and pepper fish- very oily and mostly batter. The husband got orange peel chicken. He says it was okay, tasted like Americanized Chinese food. A lot of diners near us got the bamboo pork thing. Rice is not included with entrees FYI.', u'Very bad experience.\\nI ordered Shanghai rice cake, which let me wait for about one hour. After some people  who came after me got all their dishes, I could not wait any more and let the waitress to check when would it be ready. I asked her three times and finally after 10 mins, mine was ready. By looking at the rice cake I thought it only needed about 10 mins. So before I pushed the waitress, I thought my rice cake had not even started.\\nNot sure if it was because the rice cake is cheap and they wanted to make dishes those were more expensive first no matter who came first.\\nWill never go to the restaurant again.', u'The 10 ingredients fried rice came with only five. One of them was meat inappropriately sized for the dish. Another ingredient consisted of a couple of small overcooked shrimp. And that was the best of the dishes.\\n\\nA sad excuse for chinese food. Yet the restaurant is packed so something appears to be working!', u\"I stayed in Mountain view and was looking for Asian food around the area and came across this location.  It's true that this place is in this ghetto-looking plaza but the food is pretty exceptional.  Here is my breakdown of the place.\\n\\nFood:\\nI highly suggest ordering the bamboo pork chop and rice.  It's a tad bit on the salty side but if you mix this with rice, it's actually not too bad.  In addition, I would recommend getting the xiao rong bao (dumplings).  I particularly like how they made the dumpling skin to be thinner.  Unlike most places, where the skin tends to be very thick and 'doughy'.  Also, I would recommend the smoke duck but i know a lot of my friends have mix feelings about it.  Personally, I think it's not too bad and I am a fan.  \\n\\nPlace:\\nI came here on a Sunday night at 7:30 pm.  There wasn't much of a wait.  We were seated immediately.  \\n\\nService:\\nFamily own, the food came out quickly so no complaints from me.  My only complaint is that you have to spend $25 minimum to be able use credit card.  \\n\\nParking:\\nThis place is in a pretty large plaza, so there are plenty of spaces available.\", u\"mediocre food except for steamed pork dumplings.  Everything else=mediocre.\\n\\nMany complaints\\n1.) Small place; like putting Godzilla into a porta potty.\\n2.) High prices; with what they charge, you'd think they could afford a larger place.\\nI've seen better restaurants with better food and larger places. Lika vaso azzurro, please expand this place.\\n\\nIf you come here, prepare to be ripped off and go home with an empty wallet.\\nI give this place 2.7 stars, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.\", u\"There was a black bug in our food. It was big and quite scary. We called the waiter and he said it's just a regular vegetable bug. He did not do anything to improve and even felt it was normal. That's ridiculous.\", u\"The best authentic Chinese food I've had in the peninsula. And I've been to pretty much every Chinese restaurant in the area. Usually the Palo Alto/mountain view area has Americanized Chinese food, which is OK but this spot reminds me of home cooking! Loved the sheng jian bao\", u\"Great, little family-owned restaurant with fairly decent service compared to many other Asian restaurants I've been to. I ordered the glutinous rice with pork and bamboo which was excellent. I actually wish this dish came with more rice as the richly sauced pork got quite heavy to eat towards the end. I rarely never finish a dish but I had to take part of this one back.\\n\\nI also tried their xiao long bao which was actually good quite. The skin is delicate and light but strong enough to keep all the delicious soup from seeping out. I would definitely come back to try some more of their offerings if I'm ever in the area.\", u'Tucked away and a little hard to find, this place from the outside strikes you as \"just another strip mall Chinese joint\". Which in a majority of the nation, means \"el sucko\". However around here, this place is a prime example of quality has no location.\\n\\nWalking in, the lady who I assume is the owner/manager seats us and it\\'s crowded, mostly Chinese folks. Always a good sign. The menu is expansive and there are all types of things I had never seen before, \"loofah\" being the one that stands out (it\\'s just some weird vegetable). We get two orders of the XLB (soup dumplings, hong kong style, whatever you want to call them) and these live up to the hype... best in the area hands down.\\n\\nWe tried to order the loofah soup but apparently they were out of loofah. Darn it. She suggested the green been sprouts which were fresh as all hell, vibrant color and just steamed right with some vinegar. Delicious.\\n\\nWe also ordered the glutinous rice with pork. While pork belly is usually my thing, there was just too heavy of a mushroom flavor here to really give this thing a two thumbs up, unless of course you LOVE mushrooms. Even if you just like mushrooms, it might be too heavy of a flavor. Everyone seems to love it though so I guess give it a go, but with a menu this big I will be trying other things on my next visit back.\\n\\nBecause I will be returning.', u'surprisingly good xiaolong bao! their bamboo meat dish was also very good.  I got takeout but may try to dine in here next time.', u'I have had dinner here probably 10 times by now. Sooooo good.\\n\\nxiaolongbao, Tofu-related dish, glutinous rice in bamboo is must try.\\n\\nI always come here with a Japanese friend and now the nice Chinese waitress thanked us in Japanese!', u\"Bamboo Garden is one of my top go-to restaurants for Chinese food in the Peninsula. Compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area, Bamboo Garden stands out for serving authentic Shanghainese cuisine. Almost everything I have had are delicious, salted perfectly and  untainted by MSG.\\n\\nIf this is your first time having Shanghai cuisine or first time here, here a few dishes that I highly recommend.\\n\\n-Pork and bamboo with sticky rice\\n-Loofa- soft silk squash lightly saut\\xe9ed with goji berries!\\n-Fish in rice wine sauce- fish slices are generous, soft to the bite. The rice wine really imparts wonderful texture and richness to the dish\\n-Xiao Long Bao- shanghai's famous soup dumplings which are supposedly made fresh here\\n-baby boy choy- a speciality shanghai vegetable. It's simple, saut\\xe9ed, but I would have this over other vegetables any day!\\n-tea smoked duck- this is often made too salty at other restaurants. However Bamboo Garden makes it like how it should\\ntaste in China.\\n\\nIf you haven't been to Bamboo Garden or haven't tried Shanghainse cuisine, you must visit!\", u\"Another one of those super yummy and budget friendly places on the radar. Their XLB is juicy as can be without an oil slick. Not that there's anything wrong with oil slicks but if you want tasty and not an oil bag, then come eat here. Their other dishes are good as well, and this place is extremely attractive to the Taiwanese or Shanghainese folk so be prepared to be the token whitey here if your of that color. ;)\", u\"The glutinous rice with pork is alone worth the 4 stars. Braised pork belly! With sticky rice! So excellent.\\n\\nI was surprised by the XLB: they were pretty perfect with the droop (meaning lots of broth), thin skin, and not broken! However, the taste! Blech, the taste. It was way too sweet and just had an overall strange flavor. And I eat a lot of soup dumplings.\\n\\nI think we also had the beef noodle but I can't remember which means it was nothing special and nothing offensive. I think the noodles were good.\\n\\nWorth a try for the glutinous rice.\", u\"**Open Christmas Day!**\\n\\n**3.5 Stars**\\n\\nBamboo Garden replaced a favorite restaurant of mine, Shanghai Family.  And while my initial impression when they first opened was that they didn't reach that favorite standard, they have steadily improved and we really had a great Shanghainese meal.\\n\\nXiao Long Bao - this is the go-to standard for so many restaurants and so hard to execute well.  Ours came steaming hot and were excellent in the quantity of soup broth.  The skin could have been thinner but wasn't too bad.  Enjoyed this and tasted very fresh....the best I've had here in my 3+ visits.  Nowhere near DTF level but then again no other Bay Area place is, except the very pricey renditions at Yank Sing.  Very affordable at $5.85 for 6.\\n\\nBraised Lion Pork Meatballs - not served in a clay pot as I prefer but very tender and served with a nice assortment of Chinese vegetables.  Goes well with white rice.\\n\\nBamboo Pork Rice - sticky glutinuous rice is served with fatty pork in a bamboo presentation container.  This was a new dish and one that many reviewers like.  Admittedly, as some have stated, the pork is very fatty, but that's the nature of the dish.  It was tender, very tasty, and for the health conscious, I think the braised pork meat balls above are a great alternative.\\n\\nChinese spinach - i just like this vegetable.  great portion size too.\\n\\nOverall, this was a great holiday meal.  I've been here a few things and thought a few years ago the food was so-so.  They've gradually improved and are getting busier which means there is more turnaround of materials and food preparation.  It's a good cycle.  Although Shanghai Garden is still my fave, this is a close by solid option.\\n\\nBamboo Garden accepts credit cards, but not American Express.\", u\"A small place hidden in a strip mall, if it wasn't for Yelp, I would have never noticed Bamboo Garden.\\n\\n$25 credit card minimum.\\n\\nThe glutinous rice with pork in bamboo was about what I expected.  Some tender braised pork belly in a gravy.  Fatty goodness obviously.\\n\\nHowever, the Smoked Duck was fantastic!  'Twas nicely smoked with a crispy skin and was not a fatty glob of grease.  I was very happy because usually my experience with duck at Chinese Restaurants has resulted in fatty, greasy, no meat ducks, so I love it when a place makes a good duck.\\n\\nAlthough, in the end, I think there are too many Chinese place on the peninsula for me to make the effort to return.  It is too far from me for a quick/cheap meal and does not have higher end dishes for a special occasion meal.\", u'\\u83dc\\u8272\\u7f8e\\u5473\\uff0c\\u50f9\\u683c\\u5408\\u7406\\u3002We always ordered the same takeout every Sunday for the past 6 months.  The owner already recognized my voice when I called.', u'The XLB was great!  Small hole in the wall restaurant with good dumpling selection.', u'Well, you know how I\\'ve been called \"King Of FOBenese food\" by a friend? Actually I\\'m not (but I love the name, thanks Cherylynn N.!) I just love the chit so deeply like a rat does cheese. Nibbling away, hopefully squeezing in sips of wine and slices of pear with honey in between.\\n\\nThere are some true gourmets and gourmands out there who are of the camp that think \"you are not qualified to judge food properly if a) you have not had that food in the country of origin (if ethnic food) and b) you do not understand the cooking process that goes in, how it is made traditionally so you can make valid comparisons locally vs abroad, and c) you do not cook yourself\". But also to be able to judge properly, one needs to eat often (say, of a particular cuisine) and a lot of it, of this I do agree with. But eating a ton of moo shoo poo poo doo doo broo hoo hoo unfortunately does not gain you the ranking of Emperor Moo Poo, let alone a mayor.\\n\\nAnyways, got a message from a good friend \"Dood, where can a brutha get some half decent Xiao long bao around the South Bay\"? I was like \"$heeeeeit dawg, that\\'s like asking me to find acceptable ha gow at dim sum!\". But fortunately I\\'ve had at least a few people whose opinions I trust (including from a raccoon, don\\'t ask!) who have been waiting for my take on Bamboo Garden in Mountain View. And I remember the Yelpers can\\'t stop talking about their XLB, and even those who are not just \"experts\". So without skipping a beat, I sent him the Yelp listing, to which he found some of the other dish pics interesting....so I told him I\\'d meet him there for dinner.\\n\\nNow this brutha is actually the Dark Sith Lord when it comes to Shanghainese, and he cooks too (I don\\'t). Just like Yum\\'s Bistro is my territory, anything involving Jiangnan (which oddly enoughly translates to Gangnam in written Chinese), Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, is his. I\\'m just but a young padawan outside of Cantonese food. But as his eye lit up like Superman using heat vision as he saw and dictated his favorites from the menu, I nodded in agreement, and I basically had him take the rein$. Because I omakase him.... TRU$T. RE$PECT. Oppa Jiangnan style!!!\\n\\nStarted off with Sweet and Sour Spareribs (Tang Tsoo Pai Gu). This is the OG godfather of sweet and sour pork, but Northern style, just sugar and vinegar, or arguably a sweet black vinegar. Looks as dark as a Sith costume, and it was a little colder than room temperature but not fresh out of the refrigerator. Lean sparerib cuts, with a nice chew/bite. Other than it being too sweet, it was otherwise deemed a re$pectable rendition.\\n\\nXiao long bao - At $5.95 you cannot go wrong with these. Soup whores will absolutely squeal with joy as each \"bao\" has so much soup inside it gushes like mad (insert Peter North jokes here). Watch out for \"floaties\"...by that I mean pork fat globules (congealed), does make the soup taste better. Pick up the XLB from the tip (top) because the middle sides are more fragile and it gets droopy and weighed down from the soup, dip in black vinegar, put it on the soup spoon and nom that chit. Very good and above average solid XLB rendition, excellent for this area. Even the Sith Lord found it impressive, and this padawan learned something too.\\n\\nStir fried large pea sprouts - The first choice of Loofah with gluten wheat puff and dried scallop was not available, so we went with this, and requested everything with less oil and less salt, and this still came out quite solid. Nicely done.\\n\\nStir fried rice cake slices with ji-zhai - also known as stir fried \"nian gao\", not that different from the glutinous rice cake rolls seen in Korean cuisine, except these are sliced like small cross section cuts of sausages. A little more oil (or lard) would have sealed in the heat further, maybe a tad more char. But otherwise not bad.\\n\\nBraised fish tail (hong shao hua shui) - the carp tail was a humongous piece, where it looks like a beautiful elegant brush, \"painting\" the water, hence the name hua shui. The fish appeared to be steamed first then had the sauce poured over. What\\'s respectable about this rendition is that the freshness and flavor of the fish can still be tasted and the sauce didn\\'t interfere much (it\\'s a fairly sweet sauce, almost like the spareribs but a tad different). Carp has a ton of bones, but the tail has fewer compared to the rest of the carp body. Fatty rear end (no Sir MixxALot jokes please) where the skin met flesh was tastiest. I\\'m normally not a fan of this dish, but BG\\'s rendition was very pleasing.\\n\\nGreen bean dessert soup closed the meal, mildly cold, very refreshing in this weather.\\n\\nQuoting Darth Vader: \"Impressive\".\\n\\nQuoting the Governator who impregnated a maid: \"I\\'ll be back\".', u\"We recently ate at Bamboo Gardens and the place was pretty packed at noon.  \\n\\nI am giving this 3 stars and would go there again to try some of their other dishes.\\n\\nWe ordered the beef tendon, sliced rice cake with preserved vegetables, xiao long bao, and stir fried pea shoots.  We would order all of those dishes again except for the beef tendon, which came out cold and the sauce coagulated onto the tendon.  It wasn't appetizing at all.  The other dishes were pretty tasty, with the xiao long bao standing out as the best of the bunch.  Having tried xiao long bao at a number of places in the bay area, this one ranks as one of the better places.\\n\\nThe service was decent, and the food was hit or miss.\", u'Small \"hole in the wall\" with excellent food. NO MSG in anything. Hot & Sour soup was too spicy for our kids but we enjoyed it. Dim sum pork buns were not what we expected but very good (we were thinking BBQ pork buns). Szechuan shrimp and pork belly w/sticky rice were excellent. Mu-shu vegetable was as good as any where. We obvious do not know how to order Chinese food since the table next to ours had ordered \"yellow croaker fish\" and a ribs dish that looked awesome.\\n\\nThe real bonus here is we can walk to this jewel of a restaurant. :) We\\'ll definitely be back.', u\"Everything was delicious. You know it's a good sign when you walk in and all the patrons are Chinese. We were the only white group there, and the server was very kind - she asked us if we had any questions, explained how to eat the soup dumplings, and reminded us to eat them while they were hot. Very helpful and attentive, which I wouldn't necessarily expect from a little hole-in-the-wall kind of place.\\nWe ordered the garlic eggplant, boiled fish in spicy sauce, Shanghai noodles, tofu with vegetables, and the soup dumplings. The noodles were a bit heavy on the sesame-oil taste, but overall very good.\", u\"Have never been a fan of Shanghainese cuisine (Was in Shanghai several years ago and just didn't like the flavors of most of the dishes). Well, we were looking for a nearby joint to eat at and I hadn't tried this place and knew they were Michelin recommnended, so jumped on yelp and found out what those dishes were and we were off!\\n\\nThey actually recommend four dishes, but we could only stomach three (actually two, as we had leftovers). We passed on the glutinous rice with pork belly, because we're familiar with that particular dish in my family as it is.\\n\\nWe started with the XLBs (steamed pork soup dumplings) and I thought they were overrated. Okay, but nothing amazing like I had been reading about.\\n\\nAnyways, the Shanghai baby bak choy came out and it was excellent! I've never seen bak choy like that, but you could taste it (as somebody who eats a lot of bak choy in home cooking) and it had a nice, light snappiness to each bite that I loved.  \\n\\nAs good of a dish that was, the tea smoked duck was even better! One of the better versions I've had, though the wings of the duck were omitted. I understand it's difficult to cook, since it's more firm than chickens, but I still want em! Grrrr...  \\n\\nWasn't a fan of the fish filets in wine sauce though. I was the only one who didn't like it though. Just had an overpowering flavor to it. Fish was cooked well though and the mushrooms were good.  \\n\\nEnded up being around $50 for three of us. I'd return to try the other recommended dish and to come back for the duck and baby bak choy dishes again for sure!\", u'I came here with a group of friends a few weeks ago. Their xiao long bao is better than most: ample soup inside, fresh pork, and skin strong enough to hold it all together. We also got their bamboo glutinous rice, which seems to be their signature dish. Personally, I feel like it could use more flavor, though I have to give them props for the presentation. Everything else, like the green beans, tea-smoked duck, etc., were good, but not particularly memorable.', u\"***Four stars is based solely on their XLB***\\n\\nI've been on a quest to find the best soup dumplings in the Bay Area ever since I moved here from New York over a year ago.  \\n\\nDoesn't quite measure up to Joe's Shanghai (oh, how I miss you!) but still pretty tasty.  And much better than the other places I've tried...\\n\\nAs for the other food - mediocre at best.\", u'Was very surprised at the high quality of good food and friendly service!! The smoked duck was absolutely on point. Super fresh and smokey. The soup dumplings were a little sweet but hit the spot. Nothing like joe shanghai in New York but tasted really homemade and was delicious (wish they were a little bigger though)', u\"Since Din Tai Fung may not  come to Bay Area long before Vladimir and Estragon meet Godot, Bamboo Garden is the place to go for  XLB. By the way, if Godot does come, the lines will be longer and the price will be higher, while at Bamboo Garden one just sits down and eats, without significant  weight loss of the wallet's contents. Also, I did not feel the place is a one-trick pony - it may be true that the other dishes may not be worth a long drive, they are quite decent. In addition to XLB, we had fish in wine sauce, rice with ham, and eight treasure rice. All of the above was quite good - family style, of course, but very satisfying. Also, the waitress openly told us not to get Shao Bing (which we were about to order), since on this particular day it was not at the level. I can see some reviewers complaining about the service - but it is really what you get in this kind of place - the waiters are not going to fawn over you, but simply do their job. Overall, a good restaurant - excellent XLB and fairly good at everything else\", u\"Lilly W treated me here for lunch since she knew I loved to eat xiao long bao.  She knew exactly what to order so I was happy.  If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have known what good things to order since I'm not too familiar with Shanghainese food.  For 3 people, we had quite a bit of food:\\n\\n- Xiao Long Bao (steamed pork soup dumplings)\\n- Shanghai Style Pan Fried Buns with Pork\\n- Glutinous Rice with Pork in Bamboo\\n- Sauteed Green Beans\\n- Green Onion Pancake\\n- Shanghai Baby Bok Choy\\n\\nand some eggplant dish.  I enjoyed all the dishes, but my favorite was the glutinous rice.  It was very flavorful.  Seems to be the popular dish here too!  The XLB was good, but not the best.  Eat those while they're hot!\", u\"As soon as a coworker told me about pork buns (xiao long bao, or xlb for short) I had to try them. Apparently there aren't a lot of places that make these, or that make them well, nearby. So I trusted my food connoisseur friend who found Bamboo Garden and we went for lunch.\\n\\nThe service was great - quick and friendly. But maybe I started off a little biased because our server told me I had pretty eyes. ;) I started with a complimentary hot and sour soup. I don't usually like it, but I would have asked for seconds on this if I weren't ordering more food. Very tasty.\\n\\nOur first dish was, of course, the pork buns and....YUM! I thought were really good, just a bit sticky. But I don't know if that's how they are supposed to be since it was my first time. My friend, who has had them countless times, said he liked them a lot.\\n\\nNext I had the green onion pancakes. They were okay, just a bit on the dry side. I might order them again because maybe I got a not so great batch (I went after the lunch rush). Lastly, I had the Shanghai rice cakes with chicken and veggies which I liked, it was just lacking a tiny bit of seasoning or sauce. But I loved the rice cakes (first time having those too).\\n\\nOverall, this will definitely be a new lunch spot for me!\", u\"In honor of Dumpling week (npr.org/blogs/thesalt/20\\u2026), we rode our bikes to Bamboo garden for dumplings/xlb. We ordered pork xiao long bao, kung pao prawns and pan fried shanghai dumplings. I wasn't sure how the last dish would come out but it was pretty good. Very doughy and bready. It was almost like the chef made steamed buns (like char-siu bao), filled it with the XLB filling and soup, steamed them and then pan fried them. The XLB were delicious and served piping hot with no breakage of the wrappers. The soup inside was flavorful and not a meager amount.\\n\\nThe kung pao prawns were average, spicy and lots of shrimp, water chesnuts, pepper and onion.\\n\\nBetter than the place on Castro St. but maybe not quite as tasty as R&B in Palo Alto, though priced accordingly.\", u\"Caters to the palates of the un-Americanized  Chinese and tastes like home if you don't consider chop suey authentic. My recommendations:\\n\\nDried Bamboo Shoots with (Fatty) Pork\\nHot and Sour Soup\\nDuck Stew Napa Cabbage\\nShanghai Style Pork Knuckle\\nFish Fillet with Wine Sauce\\n\\nThe steam pork buns have thick skin and so do the fried buns. I'll eagerly await the grand opening of Din Tai Feng.\", u\"Not bad, but only if you have plenty of time to kill.  \\n\\nThis place is a moderately sized sit-in restaurant located in a surprisingly shady looking shopping center in Mountain View.  There is a ton of parking and it's conveniently located right on Rengstorff, a couple minutes off the 101 exit.  The interior is not much to look at and the decor is minimal.  I came before lunchtime (11:20ish?) on a weekday and it was nearly dead empty (around lunchtime, a couple other tables filled up).  \\n\\nThe three dishes we had were pretty good overall.  The soup dumplings (quantity of 6) had a thin skin that was surprisingly resilient to the flavorful pork and crab soup filling -- one of the better ones I've had so far living on the peninsula.  We also had the sheng jian bao (fried pork buns) and they were quite good, juice on the inside and just the right amount of flavorful (however, it will take 20 minutes for it to come out so order early).  The stir fried rice cake with preserved vegetable and pork was only ok and the serving was small to average.  \\n\\nMy main gripe with this place was the slow service, despite it being an unusual mealtime.  It looked like it was being manned by just 2 people, who were overseeing the kitchen and also taking orders AND also handling take-out pickup.  While I was seated immediately (and that shouldn't be surprising, given that the restaurant was empty), my order wasn't taken for nearly half an hour while the woman at the register was bombarded by one take-out pickup after another, and the other worker was dashing in and out of the kitchen.  I also saw them putting the buns together from scratch after each order was put in, which is certainly nice but as expected, all of this took some time.  \\n\\nOverall, the food is fairly good and Mtn View has been a bit of a black hole when it comes to good Chinese food, in my opinion, especially with Sunnyvale and San Mateo nearby.  But just don't expect to get in and out in a short time frame, even on a weekday.\", u\"My review is based on trying one dish, chow mein, which is my litmus test at a Chinese restaurant.  It was very bland.  The noodles were mushy and despite being very brown, like it was covered in sauce, it was very bland.  All the meats were overly tenderized and the shrimp was not so fresh tasting.\\n\\nThere really isn't much service required but one of the two servers was really nice.\\n\\nI love noodles and since this place failed on that, I won't be back.\", u\"I would say that this place is 3.5 stars.\\n\\nI came here for lunch after church service on Sunday. Prices are decent and there is a wide selection. The XLB are good and the wrappers are thin, but I've had better in SoCal at Din Tai Fung, Dumpling House, and Mama Lu's. The Jia jia mian was pretty good. We also ordered salt and pepper fish, although it was kinda bland and not spicy compared to other restaurants such as New Port. They were very busy, so service was slow, but overall ok experience. Typical, average chinese food.\", u\"4 stars for the xiao long bao! Thin skins that don't break, gingery pork filling, soft crab filling, and delicious soup inside! Perfect ginger vinegar dipping sauce too. I've been searching for good xlb from Cupertino to San Francisco, and I haven't found a place that beats this yet.\\n\\nStandard authentic Chinese restaurant service (read: not very good service). The Shanghai cakes are also pretty good, as is the pork cooked in bamboo. But the best thing about Bamboo Garden is definitely their xlb.\", u'Great Xiao Long Bao. Pork knuckle is huge and tender. Owner is friendly and service is quick', u\"Some friends of ours are regular customers to this place.  Because they have a young baby, we offered to pick up dinner and bring it over to their place.  They placed the order.  When we arrived, we picked up dinner for 4, which was a pretty large order.  The door clearly states that they accept credit cards, but the woman would not let me pay in anything but cash.  She said that we got some special that requires paying in cash.  Pretty annoying.\\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a strip mall off of Central Expressway with Shell Gas Station on the corner.  The dining room was very basic, definitely not upscale and definitely no ambiance.  It was functional.  A bunch of large round tables might be good for groups.\\n\\nI found the food a bit too greasy and not that flavorful.  The meat also didn't taste very fresh to me.  My Chinese friend who ordered says this place is authentic, and all the people eating inside the restaurant were Chinese, so maybe this is just how legitimate Chinese food tastes.  For context, I am Asian and have had tons of Asian food all my life.  So maybe this is just how un-fresh un-flavorful legitimate Chinese food tastes.  :P\\n\\nI would only eat here again if the same friends wanted us to pick it up and bring it over for them because they have a young baby.\", u'This place is so good that I almost don\\'t want to review it out of fear that it will get popular and crowded.  The food is simply amazing.  Like other posters said, you must get xiao long bao (\"steamed dumplings\" on the menu).  But I\\'ve been many times and never had a bad dish, so try anything.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit of a hole in the wall and usually not too busy.  The staff is friendly and actually remembers us, which is nice.  Feels very homey.  Love this place.', u'Top notch XLB! So soupy and such delicate skins! Service so kind. Greens tasted so fresh and clean. Green onion pancakes and wonton soup all excellent as well. Wish this was our local spot and not 100 miles from my house!', u\"The XLB is still amazing (see my previous extensive review) and I wanted to give a shout out to their vegetable dumplings, oh that delicate skin!\\n\\nI noticed Kathleen (co-owner) wasn't looking as happy as I knew her to be in years past. Actually, she looked chronically stressed. Gotta remember to check-in on the well-being people who have been working day after day to bring us such amazing dumplings.\", u'A family-owned restaurant in a small mall that Packs a Punch!\\n\\nWhen I first walked in, the place didn\\'t look impressive. Boy was I wrong! Once our food arrived, it was insanely good. The juicy pork bun was at just the right temperature, not too hot and not too cold, with lots of juice still inside.\\n\\nWe saw the other tables in the restaurant order the \"bamboo\" rice thing and followed suit--score! The server literally cracks open the bamboo on the table in front of you, and you can see the steam coming out while the juicy goodness flows out onto the plate. Best order decision eva\\n\\nNo wonder this place was so packed!', u'When I am craving for Chinese food, this place is always my number one choice. I like the fish filets in hot chili and the sticky rice with pork belly, so good!', u'XLB would eat again. Affordable with crab.\\nMa poo lunch special can be skipped. Sauce is oily.\\nPan fried pork dumpling is pan fried XLB. Filling and fun texture.\\nVery reasonably priced.', u\"Pros:\\n- fantastic XLB\\n- good Chinese donuts + dipping milk (soymilk)\\n- I confirmed with them that they use no MSG (it's a good sign that I didn't get any MSG side-effects afterwards either)\\n- staff was very helpful in suggesting items\\n- clean place\\n\\nCons:\\n- limit of exactly 1 credit card per table\\n- the suggested items are more traditional, and may not suit American (or Chinese-American) palates well\\n\\nOther notes:\\n- it tastes like they may use soybean oil -- if you are allergic to soy, you should definitely ask them about it before eating!\", u\"I saw the Michelin recommended sheet on the other side of the restaurant, so I had hopes (plus my friends really like this place), but eh, I think it was just ok.\\n\\nWe ordered shanghai rice cakes, 2 steamers of xlb (6 in each), pork belly/bamboo/sticky rice, and a stir fried veggie. Nothing spectacular, the XLB in particular were really unremarkable. I wouldn't be able to describe it to you one week later.\\n\\nWe finished everything but a few bites (how un-Asian!) - total for four of us was around $60 after tax and tip. I'd rather go to Shanghai Dumpling - slightly better food and more spacious restaurant, plus it's a few miles closer to my apartment.\", u\"I'm native Chinese and this place sucks. Ordered ShengJianBao and I thought they forgot to put fillings inside. Completely disappointed at the dishes. No flavors and taste cheap! Not an authentic Shanghai restaurant at all. No wonder they were empty around noon on a Saturday.\", u\"Crab paste xlb - their xlb is pretty solid. Good skin. Doesn't compare to Din tai fung though. I would get the non crab paste one next time. Didn't really enjoy the crab paste\\n\\nSi gua with pork and vermicelli - very bland, pork not good, wouldn't get again\\n\\nBamboo sticky rice pork belly - tasty but too oily for me. Wouldn't get again but is worth trying if you don't mind the oiliness.\\n\\nTofu skin with pork (house special) - bland and the pork was terrible\\n\\nSpring onion pancake - not oily, very normal. Prob wouldn't get again.\\n\\nI may come back one more time when I'm feeling xlb\", u'My most frequent experience of xiao long bao was from Din Tai Fung, so it has been really hard to find decent XLB in the bay area. Finally Bamboo Garden is one place that makes a decent dumpling! You can see them making it in the back behind a window! Good prices too. The xiao long bao are good; the shen jian bao were just so so...a bit too bread-y and doughy for my liking compared to Shanghai Flavor Shop.\\n\\nThe place is a bit small so trying to go out to eat with our young kid or a large group can be hit or miss.', u'I am a semi-regular to this restaurant. The food is usually very homey. They seem to use very little MSG and oil which is rare for Chinese restaurants.\\n\\nThe Shanghai Dumplings are a must. The owner makes them after you order. The dumplings are soupy with just the right proportion of meat and a very delicate dumpling skin. Most importantly, the dumplings were not greasy like in most dim sum places.\\n\\nI also ordered the Bacon Fried Rice and the Fish with Wine Sauce.  The bacon fried rice has a lot of Chinese vegetables in it, making it a well balanced dish even though the rice and bacon are greasy. The dish more accurately resembles a clay pot rice dish, not so much a fried rice dish. The fish with wine sauce is a light and mild dish. The fish is tenderly cooked with beans and Chinese fungus, it provided a perfect compliment to the greasy fried rice that we ordered.\\n\\nThe restaurant is your typical Chinese restaurant with a small window for dumpling watching. The staff is extremely kind for a Chinese restaurant and the owner is a sweetheart that will give you recommendations if asked.\\n\\nThis is a nice and healthy homey place to eat. It is great if you want a nice dinner for yourself or take out as well. It is also extremely family friendly but I would not recommend it for atmosphere or dates.', u\"I've had it with this place. It's not the food that I want to complain about, it's their service, it's just horrendous.\\n\\nThey are so cheap.  I ordered $50 of food for 2 people, I asked for to go boxes, two of the dishes had soup in it.  She (the co-owner of the restaurant) first gave me two paper boxes, I said the soup will leak from the paper boxes, then she gave me one small plastic container, which doesn't even fit all the leftover we had.  She said the other dish would be fine in the paper box.  After we got home, everything was leaking, making a mess in our car.\\n\\nThis time I ordered their soup dumplings to go.  I should've checked before I left but I decided to trust that everything is in the bag. She packed only one piece of napkin and one pair of ragged chopsticks in there, no spoons. Everyone knows you need to eat the soup dumpling with a spoon. I ate mine without a spoon, everything was leaking and falling out when I take a small bite, food dropping into the vinegar container and splashing grease and vinegar everywhere.  All I needed was a plastic spoon!!\\n\\nC'mon!  How cheap can you be?  Can't even spare a plastic spoon for takeout???\\n\\nAlso, she demands payment in cash for anything under $25, what an unreasonable request.\\n\\nTheir food is okay, but because they constantly trying to cheap me out, I will not want to spend a dime there anymore.\", u'Soup dumplings were great. Upon arrival I wondered what else was good here. The answer is nothing (based on what we ordered). I got the salt and pepper fish- very oily and mostly batter. The husband got orange peel chicken. He says it was okay, tasted like Americanized Chinese food. A lot of diners near us got the bamboo pork thing. Rice is not included with entrees FYI.', u'Very bad experience.\\nI ordered Shanghai rice cake, which let me wait for about one hour. After some people  who came after me got all their dishes, I could not wait any more and let the waitress to check when would it be ready. I asked her three times and finally after 10 mins, mine was ready. By looking at the rice cake I thought it only needed about 10 mins. So before I pushed the waitress, I thought my rice cake had not even started.\\nNot sure if it was because the rice cake is cheap and they wanted to make dishes those were more expensive first no matter who came first.\\nWill never go to the restaurant again.', u'The 10 ingredients fried rice came with only five. One of them was meat inappropriately sized for the dish. Another ingredient consisted of a couple of small overcooked shrimp. And that was the best of the dishes.\\n\\nA sad excuse for chinese food. Yet the restaurant is packed so something appears to be working!', u\"I stayed in Mountain view and was looking for Asian food around the area and came across this location.  It's true that this place is in this ghetto-looking plaza but the food is pretty exceptional.  Here is my breakdown of the place.\\n\\nFood:\\nI highly suggest ordering the bamboo pork chop and rice.  It's a tad bit on the salty side but if you mix this with rice, it's actually not too bad.  In addition, I would recommend getting the xiao rong bao (dumplings).  I particularly like how they made the dumpling skin to be thinner.  Unlike most places, where the skin tends to be very thick and 'doughy'.  Also, I would recommend the smoke duck but i know a lot of my friends have mix feelings about it.  Personally, I think it's not too bad and I am a fan.  \\n\\nPlace:\\nI came here on a Sunday night at 7:30 pm.  There wasn't much of a wait.  We were seated immediately.  \\n\\nService:\\nFamily own, the food came out quickly so no complaints from me.  My only complaint is that you have to spend $25 minimum to be able use credit card.  \\n\\nParking:\\nThis place is in a pretty large plaza, so there are plenty of spaces available.\", u\"mediocre food except for steamed pork dumplings.  Everything else=mediocre.\\n\\nMany complaints\\n1.) Small place; like putting Godzilla into a porta potty.\\n2.) High prices; with what they charge, you'd think they could afford a larger place.\\nI've seen better restaurants with better food and larger places. Lika vaso azzurro, please expand this place.\\n\\nIf you come here, prepare to be ripped off and go home with an empty wallet.\\nI give this place 2.7 stars, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.\", u\"There was a black bug in our food. It was big and quite scary. We called the waiter and he said it's just a regular vegetable bug. He did not do anything to improve and even felt it was normal. That's ridiculous.\", u\"The best authentic Chinese food I've had in the peninsula. And I've been to pretty much every Chinese restaurant in the area. Usually the Palo Alto/mountain view area has Americanized Chinese food, which is OK but this spot reminds me of home cooking! Loved the sheng jian bao\", u\"Great, little family-owned restaurant with fairly decent service compared to many other Asian restaurants I've been to. I ordered the glutinous rice with pork and bamboo which was excellent. I actually wish this dish came with more rice as the richly sauced pork got quite heavy to eat towards the end. I rarely never finish a dish but I had to take part of this one back.\\n\\nI also tried their xiao long bao which was actually good quite. The skin is delicate and light but strong enough to keep all the delicious soup from seeping out. I would definitely come back to try some more of their offerings if I'm ever in the area.\", u'Tucked away and a little hard to find, this place from the outside strikes you as \"just another strip mall Chinese joint\". Which in a majority of the nation, means \"el sucko\". However around here, this place is a prime example of quality has no location.\\n\\nWalking in, the lady who I assume is the owner/manager seats us and it\\'s crowded, mostly Chinese folks. Always a good sign. The menu is expansive and there are all types of things I had never seen before, \"loofah\" being the one that stands out (it\\'s just some weird vegetable). We get two orders of the XLB (soup dumplings, hong kong style, whatever you want to call them) and these live up to the hype... best in the area hands down.\\n\\nWe tried to order the loofah soup but apparently they were out of loofah. Darn it. She suggested the green been sprouts which were fresh as all hell, vibrant color and just steamed right with some vinegar. Delicious.\\n\\nWe also ordered the glutinous rice with pork. While pork belly is usually my thing, there was just too heavy of a mushroom flavor here to really give this thing a two thumbs up, unless of course you LOVE mushrooms. Even if you just like mushrooms, it might be too heavy of a flavor. Everyone seems to love it though so I guess give it a go, but with a menu this big I will be trying other things on my next visit back.\\n\\nBecause I will be returning.', u'surprisingly good xiaolong bao! their bamboo meat dish was also very good.  I got takeout but may try to dine in here next time.', u'I have had dinner here probably 10 times by now. Sooooo good.\\n\\nxiaolongbao, Tofu-related dish, glutinous rice in bamboo is must try.\\n\\nI always come here with a Japanese friend and now the nice Chinese waitress thanked us in Japanese!', u\"Bamboo Garden is one of my top go-to restaurants for Chinese food in the Peninsula. Compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area, Bamboo Garden stands out for serving authentic Shanghainese cuisine. Almost everything I have had are delicious, salted perfectly and  untainted by MSG.\\n\\nIf this is your first time having Shanghai cuisine or first time here, here a few dishes that I highly recommend.\\n\\n-Pork and bamboo with sticky rice\\n-Loofa- soft silk squash lightly saut\\xe9ed with goji berries!\\n-Fish in rice wine sauce- fish slices are generous, soft to the bite. The rice wine really imparts wonderful texture and richness to the dish\\n-Xiao Long Bao- shanghai's famous soup dumplings which are supposedly made fresh here\\n-baby boy choy- a speciality shanghai vegetable. It's simple, saut\\xe9ed, but I would have this over other vegetables any day!\\n-tea smoked duck- this is often made too salty at other restaurants. However Bamboo Garden makes it like how it should\\ntaste in China.\\n\\nIf you haven't been to Bamboo Garden or haven't tried Shanghainse cuisine, you must visit!\", u\"Another one of those super yummy and budget friendly places on the radar. Their XLB is juicy as can be without an oil slick. Not that there's anything wrong with oil slicks but if you want tasty and not an oil bag, then come eat here. Their other dishes are good as well, and this place is extremely attractive to the Taiwanese or Shanghainese folk so be prepared to be the token whitey here if your of that color. ;)\", u\"The glutinous rice with pork is alone worth the 4 stars. Braised pork belly! With sticky rice! So excellent.\\n\\nI was surprised by the XLB: they were pretty perfect with the droop (meaning lots of broth), thin skin, and not broken! However, the taste! Blech, the taste. It was way too sweet and just had an overall strange flavor. And I eat a lot of soup dumplings.\\n\\nI think we also had the beef noodle but I can't remember which means it was nothing special and nothing offensive. I think the noodles were good.\\n\\nWorth a try for the glutinous rice.\", u\"**Open Christmas Day!**\\n\\n**3.5 Stars**\\n\\nBamboo Garden replaced a favorite restaurant of mine, Shanghai Family.  And while my initial impression when they first opened was that they didn't reach that favorite standard, they have steadily improved and we really had a great Shanghainese meal.\\n\\nXiao Long Bao - this is the go-to standard for so many restaurants and so hard to execute well.  Ours came steaming hot and were excellent in the quantity of soup broth.  The skin could have been thinner but wasn't too bad.  Enjoyed this and tasted very fresh....the best I've had here in my 3+ visits.  Nowhere near DTF level but then again no other Bay Area place is, except the very pricey renditions at Yank Sing.  Very affordable at $5.85 for 6.\\n\\nBraised Lion Pork Meatballs - not served in a clay pot as I prefer but very tender and served with a nice assortment of Chinese vegetables.  Goes well with white rice.\\n\\nBamboo Pork Rice - sticky glutinuous rice is served with fatty pork in a bamboo presentation container.  This was a new dish and one that many reviewers like.  Admittedly, as some have stated, the pork is very fatty, but that's the nature of the dish.  It was tender, very tasty, and for the health conscious, I think the braised pork meat balls above are a great alternative.\\n\\nChinese spinach - i just like this vegetable.  great portion size too.\\n\\nOverall, this was a great holiday meal.  I've been here a few things and thought a few years ago the food was so-so.  They've gradually improved and are getting busier which means there is more turnaround of materials and food preparation.  It's a good cycle.  Although Shanghai Garden is still my fave, this is a close by solid option.\\n\\nBamboo Garden accepts credit cards, but not American Express.\", u\"A small place hidden in a strip mall, if it wasn't for Yelp, I would have never noticed Bamboo Garden.\\n\\n$25 credit card minimum.\\n\\nThe glutinous rice with pork in bamboo was about what I expected.  Some tender braised pork belly in a gravy.  Fatty goodness obviously.\\n\\nHowever, the Smoked Duck was fantastic!  'Twas nicely smoked with a crispy skin and was not a fatty glob of grease.  I was very happy because usually my experience with duck at Chinese Restaurants has resulted in fatty, greasy, no meat ducks, so I love it when a place makes a good duck.\\n\\nAlthough, in the end, I think there are too many Chinese place on the peninsula for me to make the effort to return.  It is too far from me for a quick/cheap meal and does not have higher end dishes for a special occasion meal.\", u'\\u83dc\\u8272\\u7f8e\\u5473\\uff0c\\u50f9\\u683c\\u5408\\u7406\\u3002We always ordered the same takeout every Sunday for the past 6 months.  The owner already recognized my voice when I called.', u'The XLB was great!  Small hole in the wall restaurant with good dumpling selection.', u'Well, you know how I\\'ve been called \"King Of FOBenese food\" by a friend? Actually I\\'m not (but I love the name, thanks Cherylynn N.!) I just love the chit so deeply like a rat does cheese. Nibbling away, hopefully squeezing in sips of wine and slices of pear with honey in between.\\n\\nThere are some true gourmets and gourmands out there who are of the camp that think \"you are not qualified to judge food properly if a) you have not had that food in the country of origin (if ethnic food) and b) you do not understand the cooking process that goes in, how it is made traditionally so you can make valid comparisons locally vs abroad, and c) you do not cook yourself\". But also to be able to judge properly, one needs to eat often (say, of a particular cuisine) and a lot of it, of this I do agree with. But eating a ton of moo shoo poo poo doo doo broo hoo hoo unfortunately does not gain you the ranking of Emperor Moo Poo, let alone a mayor.\\n\\nAnyways, got a message from a good friend \"Dood, where can a brutha get some half decent Xiao long bao around the South Bay\"? I was like \"$heeeeeit dawg, that\\'s like asking me to find acceptable ha gow at dim sum!\". But fortunately I\\'ve had at least a few people whose opinions I trust (including from a raccoon, don\\'t ask!) who have been waiting for my take on Bamboo Garden in Mountain View. And I remember the Yelpers can\\'t stop talking about their XLB, and even those who are not just \"experts\". So without skipping a beat, I sent him the Yelp listing, to which he found some of the other dish pics interesting....so I told him I\\'d meet him there for dinner.\\n\\nNow this brutha is actually the Dark Sith Lord when it comes to Shanghainese, and he cooks too (I don\\'t). Just like Yum\\'s Bistro is my territory, anything involving Jiangnan (which oddly enoughly translates to Gangnam in written Chinese), Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, is his. I\\'m just but a young padawan outside of Cantonese food. But as his eye lit up like Superman using heat vision as he saw and dictated his favorites from the menu, I nodded in agreement, and I basically had him take the rein$. Because I omakase him.... TRU$T. RE$PECT. Oppa Jiangnan style!!!\\n\\nStarted off with Sweet and Sour Spareribs (Tang Tsoo Pai Gu). This is the OG godfather of sweet and sour pork, but Northern style, just sugar and vinegar, or arguably a sweet black vinegar. Looks as dark as a Sith costume, and it was a little colder than room temperature but not fresh out of the refrigerator. Lean sparerib cuts, with a nice chew/bite. Other than it being too sweet, it was otherwise deemed a re$pectable rendition.\\n\\nXiao long bao - At $5.95 you cannot go wrong with these. Soup whores will absolutely squeal with joy as each \"bao\" has so much soup inside it gushes like mad (insert Peter North jokes here). Watch out for \"floaties\"...by that I mean pork fat globules (congealed), does make the soup taste better. Pick up the XLB from the tip (top) because the middle sides are more fragile and it gets droopy and weighed down from the soup, dip in black vinegar, put it on the soup spoon and nom that chit. Very good and above average solid XLB rendition, excellent for this area. Even the Sith Lord found it impressive, and this padawan learned something too.\\n\\nStir fried large pea sprouts - The first choice of Loofah with gluten wheat puff and dried scallop was not available, so we went with this, and requested everything with less oil and less salt, and this still came out quite solid. Nicely done.\\n\\nStir fried rice cake slices with ji-zhai - also known as stir fried \"nian gao\", not that different from the glutinous rice cake rolls seen in Korean cuisine, except these are sliced like small cross section cuts of sausages. A little more oil (or lard) would have sealed in the heat further, maybe a tad more char. But otherwise not bad.\\n\\nBraised fish tail (hong shao hua shui) - the carp tail was a humongous piece, where it looks like a beautiful elegant brush, \"painting\" the water, hence the name hua shui. The fish appeared to be steamed first then had the sauce poured over. What\\'s respectable about this rendition is that the freshness and flavor of the fish can still be tasted and the sauce didn\\'t interfere much (it\\'s a fairly sweet sauce, almost like the spareribs but a tad different). Carp has a ton of bones, but the tail has fewer compared to the rest of the carp body. Fatty rear end (no Sir MixxALot jokes please) where the skin met flesh was tastiest. I\\'m normally not a fan of this dish, but BG\\'s rendition was very pleasing.\\n\\nGreen bean dessert soup closed the meal, mildly cold, very refreshing in this weather.\\n\\nQuoting Darth Vader: \"Impressive\".\\n\\nQuoting the Governator who impregnated a maid: \"I\\'ll be back\".', u\"We recently ate at Bamboo Gardens and the place was pretty packed at noon.  \\n\\nI am giving this 3 stars and would go there again to try some of their other dishes.\\n\\nWe ordered the beef tendon, sliced rice cake with preserved vegetables, xiao long bao, and stir fried pea shoots.  We would order all of those dishes again except for the beef tendon, which came out cold and the sauce coagulated onto the tendon.  It wasn't appetizing at all.  The other dishes were pretty tasty, with the xiao long bao standing out as the best of the bunch.  Having tried xiao long bao at a number of places in the bay area, this one ranks as one of the better places.\\n\\nThe service was decent, and the food was hit or miss.\", u'Small \"hole in the wall\" with excellent food. NO MSG in anything. Hot & Sour soup was too spicy for our kids but we enjoyed it. Dim sum pork buns were not what we expected but very good (we were thinking BBQ pork buns). Szechuan shrimp and pork belly w/sticky rice were excellent. Mu-shu vegetable was as good as any where. We obvious do not know how to order Chinese food since the table next to ours had ordered \"yellow croaker fish\" and a ribs dish that looked awesome.\\n\\nThe real bonus here is we can walk to this jewel of a restaurant. :) We\\'ll definitely be back.', u\"Everything was delicious. You know it's a good sign when you walk in and all the patrons are Chinese. We were the only white group there, and the server was very kind - she asked us if we had any questions, explained how to eat the soup dumplings, and reminded us to eat them while they were hot. Very helpful and attentive, which I wouldn't necessarily expect from a little hole-in-the-wall kind of place.\\nWe ordered the garlic eggplant, boiled fish in spicy sauce, Shanghai noodles, tofu with vegetables, and the soup dumplings. The noodles were a bit heavy on the sesame-oil taste, but overall very good.\", u\"Have never been a fan of Shanghainese cuisine (Was in Shanghai several years ago and just didn't like the flavors of most of the dishes). Well, we were looking for a nearby joint to eat at and I hadn't tried this place and knew they were Michelin recommnended, so jumped on yelp and found out what those dishes were and we were off!\\n\\nThey actually recommend four dishes, but we could only stomach three (actually two, as we had leftovers). We passed on the glutinous rice with pork belly, because we're familiar with that particular dish in my family as it is.\\n\\nWe started with the XLBs (steamed pork soup dumplings) and I thought they were overrated. Okay, but nothing amazing like I had been reading about.\\n\\nAnyways, the Shanghai baby bak choy came out and it was excellent! I've never seen bak choy like that, but you could taste it (as somebody who eats a lot of bak choy in home cooking) and it had a nice, light snappiness to each bite that I loved.  \\n\\nAs good of a dish that was, the tea smoked duck was even better! One of the better versions I've had, though the wings of the duck were omitted. I understand it's difficult to cook, since it's more firm than chickens, but I still want em! Grrrr...  \\n\\nWasn't a fan of the fish filets in wine sauce though. I was the only one who didn't like it though. Just had an overpowering flavor to it. Fish was cooked well though and the mushrooms were good.  \\n\\nEnded up being around $50 for three of us. I'd return to try the other recommended dish and to come back for the duck and baby bak choy dishes again for sure!\", u'I came here with a group of friends a few weeks ago. Their xiao long bao is better than most: ample soup inside, fresh pork, and skin strong enough to hold it all together. We also got their bamboo glutinous rice, which seems to be their signature dish. Personally, I feel like it could use more flavor, though I have to give them props for the presentation. Everything else, like the green beans, tea-smoked duck, etc., were good, but not particularly memorable.', u\"***Four stars is based solely on their XLB***\\n\\nI've been on a quest to find the best soup dumplings in the Bay Area ever since I moved here from New York over a year ago.  \\n\\nDoesn't quite measure up to Joe's Shanghai (oh, how I miss you!) but still pretty tasty.  And much better than the other places I've tried...\\n\\nAs for the other food - mediocre at best.\", u'Was very surprised at the high quality of good food and friendly service!! The smoked duck was absolutely on point. Super fresh and smokey. The soup dumplings were a little sweet but hit the spot. Nothing like joe shanghai in New York but tasted really homemade and was delicious (wish they were a little bigger though)', u\"Since Din Tai Fung may not  come to Bay Area long before Vladimir and Estragon meet Godot, Bamboo Garden is the place to go for  XLB. By the way, if Godot does come, the lines will be longer and the price will be higher, while at Bamboo Garden one just sits down and eats, without significant  weight loss of the wallet's contents. Also, I did not feel the place is a one-trick pony - it may be true that the other dishes may not be worth a long drive, they are quite decent. In addition to XLB, we had fish in wine sauce, rice with ham, and eight treasure rice. All of the above was quite good - family style, of course, but very satisfying. Also, the waitress openly told us not to get Shao Bing (which we were about to order), since on this particular day it was not at the level. I can see some reviewers complaining about the service - but it is really what you get in this kind of place - the waiters are not going to fawn over you, but simply do their job. Overall, a good restaurant - excellent XLB and fairly good at everything else\", u\"Lilly W treated me here for lunch since she knew I loved to eat xiao long bao.  She knew exactly what to order so I was happy.  If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have known what good things to order since I'm not too familiar with Shanghainese food.  For 3 people, we had quite a bit of food:\\n\\n- Xiao Long Bao (steamed pork soup dumplings)\\n- Shanghai Style Pan Fried Buns with Pork\\n- Glutinous Rice with Pork in Bamboo\\n- Sauteed Green Beans\\n- Green Onion Pancake\\n- Shanghai Baby Bok Choy\\n\\nand some eggplant dish.  I enjoyed all the dishes, but my favorite was the glutinous rice.  It was very flavorful.  Seems to be the popular dish here too!  The XLB was good, but not the best.  Eat those while they're hot!\", u\"As soon as a coworker told me about pork buns (xiao long bao, or xlb for short) I had to try them. Apparently there aren't a lot of places that make these, or that make them well, nearby. So I trusted my food connoisseur friend who found Bamboo Garden and we went for lunch.\\n\\nThe service was great - quick and friendly. But maybe I started off a little biased because our server told me I had pretty eyes. ;) I started with a complimentary hot and sour soup. I don't usually like it, but I would have asked for seconds on this if I weren't ordering more food. Very tasty.\\n\\nOur first dish was, of course, the pork buns and....YUM! I thought were really good, just a bit sticky. But I don't know if that's how they are supposed to be since it was my first time. My friend, who has had them countless times, said he liked them a lot.\\n\\nNext I had the green onion pancakes. They were okay, just a bit on the dry side. I might order them again because maybe I got a not so great batch (I went after the lunch rush). Lastly, I had the Shanghai rice cakes with chicken and veggies which I liked, it was just lacking a tiny bit of seasoning or sauce. But I loved the rice cakes (first time having those too).\\n\\nOverall, this will definitely be a new lunch spot for me!\", u\"In honor of Dumpling week (npr.org/blogs/thesalt/20\\u2026), we rode our bikes to Bamboo garden for dumplings/xlb. We ordered pork xiao long bao, kung pao prawns and pan fried shanghai dumplings. I wasn't sure how the last dish would come out but it was pretty good. Very doughy and bready. It was almost like the chef made steamed buns (like char-siu bao), filled it with the XLB filling and soup, steamed them and then pan fried them. The XLB were delicious and served piping hot with no breakage of the wrappers. The soup inside was flavorful and not a meager amount.\\n\\nThe kung pao prawns were average, spicy and lots of shrimp, water chesnuts, pepper and onion.\\n\\nBetter than the place on Castro St. but maybe not quite as tasty as R&B in Palo Alto, though priced accordingly.\"]"

    "FIELD4":"[u\"Beautiful, delicious, fresh sushi!  \\n\\nI've lived in the area for 5 years but I've held off trying Joy Sushi because I figured how good can this sushi place off in the back of a strip mall in the middle of Middlefield be?  One night, strapped for new options I decided to bite the bullet and give it a shot.  BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!!  Joy sushi knocked it out of the park with their welcoming atmosphere, their mom & pop feel, and their delicious sushi.  I've gotten various rolls (Tiger, Lambada, Rainbow, a few others) as well as their lunch bento boxes and their sashimi and nigiri.  It's *all* good.  I've gone 20+ times since then, and have introduced my coworkers to Joy sushi as well and they all love it too.  \\n\\nGive Joy Sushi a shot, you won't be disappointed.  \\n\\nSince it's in a strip mall parking is not an issue, but if you go at lunch time, around 12:15 occasionally you may wait 5-10 mins for a table b/c the dining area isn't very large.\", u\"Beautiful, delicious sushi made with care.\\nFresh fish! Gorgeous rolls. Perfect Sashimi.\\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say they have the best sushi in Mountain View.\\nHere's a tip, though: either call ahead to see if your to go order is ready, or wait an extra 20/30 minutes to pick up as they are almost always running behind. It's totally worth it, though! Yum!\", u\"This place is a nice place to eat at if you want to avoid the craziness that is Castro parking. The fish isn't of the best quality, but I must say the service is excellent, and the food is pretty well priced for the portions they give you.\\n\\nWith dinner, everyone is given a bowl of miso soup and a salad, and sometimes the woman who works there (maybe the owner?) comes by with free seaweed tempura which is very nice.\\n\\nThe sashimi is pretty solid and well priced (may be frozen before, idk but still tasty) and all of the rolls are huge.\", u'Love this place. It has the roll I can never find anywhere. I just want a cali roll with shrimp tempura inside and then salmon on top. The 1st roll is all I need and it makes me oh so happy. Please go and find me a place that has those exact things.', u\"Ordered: sake/hamachi sashimi, tempura, lobster roll, and giant roll\\nWhat to order: sashimi, giant roll\\n\\nDefinitely planning to head back to this place to try the other rolls/entrees. The service was great and we even got free tempura fried seaweed! Miso soup and a salad often comes with whatever you're order. It's a lot of food btdubs.\\n\\nSashimi - for 8 slices, we got it for $10, which is really good. I think they should have left it out for a bit more, since you could tell that toward the core of the slice, that it was previously frozen. Nevertheless, it didn't detract away from the texture and taste of the fish after we finished our rolls.\\n\\nTempura - standard.\\n\\nLobster roll - there's this weird candied mango sauce on top of it. Aside from that, pretty good.\\n\\nGiant roll - we just wanted some eel in the mix.\", u\"For $9-$10 lunch bentos this place is a steal!.  The 2 item bentos are pretty good for the price.  They come with a sufficient amount of food at a decent quality.  The sashimi they serve here is huge!  I haven't had a chance to try their sushi yet, but I may in the future.  They also take orders via an app called Order Ahead so if you're just doing pickup, its a breeze.  This is a great lunch spot though, but be careful it does get fairly busy around noon on weekdays.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nIf you want to use their order ahead service, make sure you specify the sauces you want.  The first time I got my tonkatsu sauce, the second time I didn't... It feels so incomplete, I wish they had been more conscious about that.  Also the first time, it was pork tonkatsu, the second time it was beef tonkatsu.  Consistency guys...  I'd be tempted to drop it to a 2 star, but I still like the place for the most part, the dine-in service is great, just make sure you beware if you're doing takeout\\n\\nUpdate #2:\\nI really like your food, but jeez get my order right with the takeout.  I specifically instructed to get the tonkatsu sauce which I got in my order this time, however they forgot the soy sauce for my sushi...  I think I'll have to draw a picture next time...\", u\"Really good sushi in a tiny place in the middle of corporate Mountain View. My boss loves this place and so we came here for one of our lunches. I had the veg mix roll and Bay Bridge roll since I was vegetarian for a month. They were both good, and really good portions too! I'd definitely come back!\", u\"I've had better - the California rolls had too much mayo for me and the salmon hand roll was skin not meat as the menu stated.\", u'Wonderful, fresh, and creative.  Great customer service. 4 of us went last night and stayed for 3 hours and had a wonderful time. Will definitely return.', u\"THE best :)\\n\\nBecause of the great service, I can enjoy my sushi every time I come.\\nI love their food from the salad and to the chirashi!!\\nIt gets packed during lunch, but there's a reason for that, right? :)\\nCan't wait to come back and satisfy my tummy!\", u\"Our server Daniel was phenomenal! He was friendly, prompt, and generous with our service. We came here the day before Christmas Eve and he offered us a free large sake (as long as we promised to drive safely) after finishing our purchased large sake.  Seriously?! I'm not a huge fan of the tipping phenomenon in the states but I'll (try to) tip the crap out of you if you're kind and generous like this guy! We also received a salad and miso soup after ordering 2 rolls, which is pretty uncommon based on the many sushi places I've visited. We cheers'ed with another couple as well as the sushi chef and overall, had fantastic time! I work across the street and rarely come here but would definitely recommend Joy Sushi to anyone in the area. Thanks Daniel and thank you Joy Sushi for the wonderful dinner!!\", u\"Definitely a great place to go eat sushi! not the best of quality but the quaint little family atmosphere was great :)\\n\\nI went here with two of my friends last night just to grab a bite for dinner. I got four rolls (so ambitious).. I got the tuna roll, eel roll, gyoza roll, and foster city roll. I don't recommend the foster city roll and the gyoza roll was better than I thought!\\n\\nThe price is pretty average compared to sushi places. The service was great and the Korean family was really good to be around. I would definitely come back to try the other rolls!\", u\"We live just down the road and this is our go-to sushi spot. Years ago before this location opened up the Mrs. and I would drive up to downtown San Mateo to go to Joy's first location, so needless to say we were pumped when we saw this one open up around the corner. While the prices are comparable to other sushi joints in the area, Joy Sushi's rolls are ENORMOUS and definitely give you more bang for your buck. Salmon Paradise, Baked Lobster, Samurai, and Geisha rolls are favorites of mine, along with the Monster roll (if you're looking for something on the adventurous/deep fried side). If you live in Mountain View/Sunnyvale and love sushi, definitely give this place a try!\", u'I finally was able to take the family to this nice place after trying a few times on my own, but just happened to show-up during closed hours.  I guess 3rd times a charm and boy was it ever.\\n\\nAs soon as we opened the door to walk in for dinner, we were immediately greeted by the gentlemen behind the counter that were preparing the sushi.  After our waiter took our order, the very nice Japanese lady (I think the owner) gracefully greeted us and provided our water.  She was impressed when she saw my 10 yr old son fiddling around in trying to speed-solve his 2x2 Rubik\\'s cube.  When she said she would have a hard time solving all the colors together, my son put the cube down on the table and said \"DONE\".  Boy did that impress the lady.  She kept calling him genius child.  =)  \\n\\nMy daughters and I each ordered the Bento Box, my son the Child\\'s Bento, and my wife the Nabeyaki Udon soup.  All within reasonable price and the portions were plenty.  My wife complimented that the soup wasn\\'t heavy at all and after taking a taste, I fell in love with the consistency of the Udon (Al dente) and flavor of the broth and ingredients (shitake mushroom, napa cabbage and other goodies).  All the food we ordered was very delicious and satisfying.  Out of all the sushi places we\\'ve tried in the city, I think we finally found our favorite Sushi place and our delicious meals and friendly service summed it all up.  We also noticed a large number of people coming in and out picking up their take-out orders.    \\n\\nWhen the nice lady was about to leave for home, she stopped by back at our table and graciously thanked us for coming by the restaurant that evening.  To our surprise, 3 minutes later, one of the gentlemen came to our table and gave us a full tempura crab sushi roll on the house.  I think this was all in part due to my son putting an impression on the kind lady when he solved the Rubik\\'s cube.  We\\'ve never experienced that level of kindness before.  \\n\\nNot only is the food great here, but it\\'s a plus having them in the neighborhood and just down the street from us.  It\\'s truly a hidden gem indeed.  The people and owners here are very gracious and the atmosphere and energy is very positive.  We\\'ll be back again for years to come.  Please give them a try and I hope you leave impressed as well.', u\"Nice sushi place and the online ordering SO CONVENIENT!\\nLove that!\\n\\nStandard Californian Japanese sushi place! Their Teryaki chicken is good and their sushis too. I've tried it already a dozen of times and they were always fresh.\\n\\nHowever sometimes they seem to give the wrong cut of salmon on their sushis (that is why I don't give 5 stars)\\n\\nI also like their Cali rolls with fake crab meat. They are well made and nicely seasoned. Not overwhelming or breaking apart.\\n\\nWell, it is a nice place to go have lunch if you live/work around!\\n\\nI'll try their rolls one day... Will give an updated review!\\n\\nAlso I wish their online ordering menu was more diversified. It is quite limited.\", u\"I work nearby, across the street to be exact. Came here after work one day with the coworkers desperate for a drink.. the restaurant was closed for their mid-day break but after we asked them if we can just sit at the corner & have a cup of beer, promising that we will not bother them the entire time, they welcomed us in with open arms.  \\nSuper friendly and funny staff.\\n\\nIts a small ma+pops place & trust me, they make u feel like you're at your own grandma&pops place. The woman is the sweetest & cutest thing ever. And the man who works behind the counter doesn't fall short behind her.\\n\\nAside from their wonderful services, the sushi there is amazing. I got the 2 item bento box with hamachi & salmon sashimi & both the fish were extremely fresh & savory. It literally melted in my mouth.\\n\\nDef my to-go place for outings during lunch break or afterwork (even tho I wished that they were open between the hours of 4-5 as well since thats when I get off of work heh.\", u'Love joy sushi. Friendly service, fresh sushi, and big serving sizes. Also check in for the free green tea ice cream! :)', u'Really good food for a cheap price, at least for lunch, and large portions.  Everyone at the table got a bento box with soup, salad, rice, and two entree items. They also threw in a free dessert! When I unlocked the green tea ice cream, the whole table got it!\\n\\nVery friendly staff and good service. The owner made sure to come up to us and start conversation and asked questions.', u\"My first experience couldn't have been better! The food is delicious, the roll sizes are considerably big and there are many different options in the menu. Very friendly service too.\\nDon't expect a fancy or cool restaurant, but the food is definitely 5 stars!\", u'The restaurant is tiny and was pretty busy when we went for lunch. I tried a bento box with chicken teriyaki and tonkotsu. The chicken was good but the tonkotsu was a bit overcooked. The sushi looked better so maybe I will try that next time. This is a great spot for some Japanese if you want to avoid downtown crowds.', u\"Friendly service and good sushi! They have a good variety of cooked and uncooked rolls which makes it hard to choose which one to try first since they all look scrumptious! The Samurai roll was absolutely delicious! It contains salmon, tuna, imitation crab, and other good stuff. The Unagi nigiri is super yummy but smaller than other restaurants. I choose quality over quantity any day when it comes to Sushi! I'll definitely be back here. I'll just be indecisive on which roll to choose next!\", u\"Now my favorite Japanese restaurant in the area.  Their sushi and sashimi is fresh and delicious, and the chirashi is plentiful and has a fantastic selection.  But my very favorite dishes there are actually all hot foods and appetizers.  The salmon and hamachi kama are done just right and come with a great dipping sauce, the grilled squid is fantastic, they have potato croquettes, and there's a lightly-cooked ahi tuna appetizer that is so yummy.  And it's all pretty inexpensive compared to some of the other places around here!  \\n\\nOnly thing to watch out for is they sometimes forget that you ordered some items.  But if you remind them that you haven't gotten stuff yet, they'll hurry and make them for you.  Given how yummy their food is, I think it's totally worth putting up with.\", u\"Ate here for dinner tonight for the first time and we left very happy! Neither my boyfriend or I eat fish but love Japanese food. We had two different veggie rolls, the potsticker roll, and chicken teriyaki roll. They were all delicious, especially the potsticker roll which had a nice little crunch to it. The place was clean and all the staff were very attentive and friendly. We were given a free tempura seaweed appetizer as an apology for the food taking too long which was really nice of them, but we didn't think it was taking long at all! We will be back for sure!\\n\\nI also like that their menu includes pictures of all the different rolls. They all looked so amazing that I may even be ambitious next time and try something with crab and shrimp :) we'll see!\", u\"Don't go here expecting a 3-star experience - it will be either 4 or 2. Staff is always nice - though there seems to be lots of turnover. Manager / Sushi chef is awesome and very accommodating. We are semi-regulars and would go more if the food was more consistent.\", u\"This is my favorite place in town. Small little joint but everyone is friendly and they know their regulars. The fish is always fresh. Great selection of rolls. They are closed Sunday's though. I come here all the time and the sushi is great everytime!\", u'This is an decent sushi place, might not seem that way from outside. I have been coming here almost every week for the last year, and left happy every time. There is soup and salad that comes with most orders. The staff is really nice every time, especially he manager lady. Always comes out to greet everyone. There is always plenty of parking.', u\"Super friendly. Not too expensive and decent Sushi. My kids love this place. They have deep fried seaweed appetizer that's nice and the Inari is very good.\", u\"This is my favorite place for sushi. I have not had a single thing there that I haven't loved. The staff are wonderful (except for the older lady that rushes you when it is busy. She can be a bit rude).\\n\\nThey recently updated the menus which are very nice now. The pictures are accurate and have numbered recommendations for the most popular items (which is a helpful way to pick something new to try).\\n\\nThe only drawback is this place is very small... And busy, so you hit the lunch rush you are either packed in like sardines and rushed, or waiting outside in a line. I am inclined to take a star off for that, but the food is worth it.\\n\\nOne last thing... I like that they use better quality chopsticks that don't splinter.\", u\"Joy is conveniently located very close to my office, so I have lots of coworkers that go here and rave about the food and speed. I was quite sceptical on my first visit because I believe I've already found the south bay gold standard for sushi (Mizu) and didn't know if I'd like anything less.\\n\\nI'd say my first visit was a 4-star experience. I got a lunch bento box, which was a lot of food and the sashimi was excellent quality and tasted great. I got in and out within an hour, so it definitely met my requirements.\\n\\nMy next visit I decided to go with rolls instead; the Lambada and the Cherry Blossom were my choices to gorge myself over lunch. They were fresh, well rolled, and had a good ratio of rice to fish. They also brought around a complimentary roll (that I didn't eat), which I thought was really cool. Again, a 4-star experience.\\n\\nUnfortunately, upon subsequent visits, I've had issues. The overall service is inconsistent; there are some times they're very attentive, and there are some times they don't pay attention to you or bring you another bill right after you've paid. Also, I've had an instance where the quality of my Lambada roll wasn't very good ... they stuck off-color bits with skin still on in the middle. While I realize there may be other sushi places that do that, it's not the practice of a 4 or 5 star sushi place.\\n\\nLong story short, it's a 3-star place that I think is worth going to, but inconsistent.\", u'This place is tucked away in the back of a small strip mall at Whisman and Middlefield,  I had no idea it was  there (despite the fact that I drive by that area almost daily.)

People should go visit this place\", u\"Came here for dinner with a friend since I had previously purchased a Yelp deal! The restaurant is quite cozy, one of the smaller sushi joints I've been to. It was a pretty slow night. I think they may have about 10 tables but it was just us and another table. We were greeted and seated immediately and our waitress asked what we'd like to drink. My friend and I got tea and water. Then she brought our complimentary miso soup and salad! The soup was average, I had three pieces of tofu and one piece of seaweed. The salad was premixed with dressing, heavy on the dressing.\\n\\nWe ordered the mixed tempura, lobster roll, island roll & joy king roll. I was so excited to try the lobster roll because some of the other reviewers had mentioned it was amazing but it was just okay to me. It was way over sauced, it overwhelmed the roll for me. The island roll was good though, it felt like a lighter version. The joy king roll, which is baked, was like the lion king roll at other places. It was actually the smallest roll of the three. I felt like there wasn't enough sauce on that one, the salmon was kind of dry. I can't really tell how fresh the fish was because of all the sauces. The mixed tempura was just alright, it had much more breading than I'm used to having at sushi places so I found it to be extremely filling.\\n\\nI was STARVING when we finally got here. My GPS was giving me issues so it took awhile to get here. When our food was brought out, we realized that it was way too much for us! The island and lobster rolls were 8 pieces each! The joy king roll had 6 pieces. Then we had 6 pieces in our mixed tempura! We ended up only eating half and took the rest home.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice, she checked up on us several times, gave us extra ginger & refilled our tea. I understood that it was slow but I felt a bit uncomfortable with her standing so close to us (we sat near the kitchen/bar area) while she was checking on what I presumed was her phone. It was nice to try a new sushi place but I'm not sure I would come back. Maybe lunch would be worth a shot if I'm ever in the area. To recap, good for big rolls and freebies but that's pretty much it.\", u'I usually get salmon teriyaki and the portions are a good size for what you pay.

Honestly, the elder lady that works there is so friendly and very sweet! Our orders are always received under 30min and done perfectly every time! Dragon roll was always my favorite. Sometimes they give us free treats \"on the house\" and they have so many selections on the menu with pictures!  dont know why it has 3 1/2 stars rating but this is totally the type of sushi place id go when im hungry.', u\"Excellent sushi and bento box was a lot of food and very tasty. I had the shirt rib and spicy chicken. Service is fast and courteous even though we brought a 3 month old baby. I'm definitely making Joy my new sushi goto place.\", u\"Beautiful, delicious, fresh sushi!  \\n\\nI've lived in the area for 5 years but I've held off trying Joy Sushi because I figured how good can this sushi place off in the back of a strip mall in the middle of Middlefield be?  One night, strapped for new options I decided to bite the bullet and give it a shot.  BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!!  Joy sushi knocked it out of the park with their welcoming atmosphere, their mom & pop feel, and their delicious sushi.  I've gotten various rolls (Tiger, Lambada, Rainbow, a few others) as well as their lunch bento boxes and their sashimi and nigiri.  It's *all* good.  I've gone 20+ times since then, and have introduced my coworkers to Joy sushi as well and they all love it too.  \\n\\nGive Joy Sushi a shot, you won't be disappointed.  \\n\\nSince it's in a strip mall parking is not an issue, but if you go at lunch time, around 12:15 occasionally you may wait 5-10 mins for a table b/c the dining area isn't very large.\", u\"Beautiful, delicious sushi made with care.\\nFresh fish! Gorgeous rolls. Perfect Sashimi.\\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say they have the best sushi in Mountain View.\\nHere's a tip, though: either call ahead to see if your to go order is ready, or wait an extra 20/30 minutes to pick up as they are almost always running behind. It's totally worth it, though! Yum!\", u\"This place is a nice place to eat at if you want to avoid the craziness that is Castro parking. The fish isn't of the best quality, but I must say the service is excellent, and the food is pretty well priced for the portions they give you.\\n\\nWith dinner, everyone is given a bowl of miso soup and a salad, and sometimes the woman who works there (maybe the owner?) comes by with free seaweed tempura which is very nice.\\n\\nThe sashimi is pretty solid and well priced (may be frozen before, idk but still tasty) and all of the rolls are huge.\", u'Love this place. It has the roll I can never find anywhere. I just want a cali roll with shrimp tempura inside and then salmon on top. The 1st roll is all I need and it makes me oh so happy. Please go and find me a place that has those exact things.', u\"Ordered: sake/hamachi sashimi, tempura, lobster roll, and giant roll\\nWhat to order: sashimi, giant roll\\n\\nDefinitely planning to head back to this place to try the other rolls/entrees. The service was great and we even got free tempura fried seaweed! Miso soup and a salad often comes with whatever you're order. It's a lot of food btdubs.\\n\\nSashimi - for 8 slices, we got it for $10, which is really good. I think they should have left it out for a bit more, since you could tell that toward the core of the slice, that it was previously frozen. Nevertheless, it didn't detract away from the texture and taste of the fish after we finished our rolls.\\n\\nTempura - standard.\\n\\nLobster roll - there's this weird candied mango sauce on top of it. Aside from that, pretty good.\\n\\nGiant roll - we just wanted some eel in the mix.\", u\"For $9-$10 lunch bentos this place is a steal!.  The 2 item bentos are pretty good for the price.  They come with a sufficient amount of food at a decent quality.  The sashimi they serve here is huge!  I haven't had a chance to try their sushi yet, but I may in the future.  They also take orders via an app called Order Ahead so if you're just doing pickup, its a breeze.  This is a great lunch spot though, but be careful it does get fairly busy around noon on weekdays.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nIf you want to use their order ahead service, make sure you specify the sauces you want.  The first time I got my tonkatsu sauce, the second time I didn't... It feels so incomplete, I wish they had been more conscious about that.  Also the first time, it was pork tonkatsu, the second time it was beef tonkatsu.  Consistency guys...  I'd be tempted to drop it to a 2 star, but I still like the place for the most part, the dine-in service is great, just make sure you beware if you're doing takeout\\n\\nUpdate #2:\\nI really like your food, but jeez get my order right with the takeout.  I specifically instructed to get the tonkatsu sauce which I got in my order this time, however they forgot the soy sauce for my sushi...  I think I'll have to draw a picture next time...\", u\"Really good sushi in a tiny place in the middle of corporate Mountain View. My boss loves this place and so we came here for one of our lunches. I had the veg mix roll and Bay Bridge roll since I was vegetarian for a month. They were both good, and really good portions too! I'd definitely come back!\", u\"I've had better - the California rolls had too much mayo for me and the salmon hand roll was skin not meat as the menu stated.\", u'Wonderful, fresh, and creative.  Great customer service. 4 of us went last night and stayed for 3 hours and had a wonderful time. Will definitely return.', u\"THE best :)\\n\\nBecause of the great service, I can enjoy my sushi every time I come.\\nI love their food from the salad and to the chirashi!!\\nIt gets packed during lunch, but there's a reason for that, right? :)\\nCan't wait to come back and satisfy my tummy!\", u\"Our server Daniel was phenomenal! He was friendly, prompt, and generous with our service. We came here the day before Christmas Eve and he offered us a free large sake (as long as we promised to drive safely) after finishing our purchased large sake.  Seriously?! I'm not a huge fan of the tipping phenomenon in the states but I'll (try to) tip the crap out of you if you're kind and generous like this guy! We also received a salad and miso soup after ordering 2 rolls, which is pretty uncommon based on the many sushi places I've visited. We cheers'ed with another couple as well as the sushi chef and overall, had fantastic time! I work across the street and rarely come here but would definitely recommend Joy Sushi to anyone in the area. Thanks Daniel and thank you Joy Sushi for the wonderful dinner!!\", u\"Definitely a great place to go eat sushi! not the best of quality but the quaint little family atmosphere was great :)\\n\\nI went here with two of my friends last night just to grab a bite for dinner. I got four rolls (so ambitious).. I got the tuna roll, eel roll, gyoza roll, and foster city roll. I don't recommend the foster city roll and the gyoza roll was better than I thought!\\n\\nThe price is pretty average compared to sushi places. The service was great and the Korean family was really good to be around. I would definitely come back to try the other rolls!\", u\"We live just down the road and this is our go-to sushi spot. Years ago before this location opened up the Mrs. and I would drive up to downtown San Mateo to go to Joy's first location, so needless to say we were pumped when we saw this one open up around the corner. While the prices are comparable to other sushi joints in the area, Joy Sushi's rolls are ENORMOUS and definitely give you more bang for your buck. Salmon Paradise, Baked Lobster, Samurai, and Geisha rolls are favorites of mine, along with the Monster roll (if you're looking for something on the adventurous/deep fried side). If you live in Mountain View/Sunnyvale and love sushi, definitely give this place a try!\", u'I finally was able to take the family to this nice place after trying a few times on my own, but just happened to show-up during closed hours.  I guess 3rd times a charm and boy was it ever.\\n\\nAs soon as we opened the door to walk in for dinner, we were immediately greeted by the gentlemen behind the counter that were preparing the sushi.  After our waiter took our order, the very nice Japanese lady (I think the owner) gracefully greeted us and provided our water.  She was impressed when she saw my 10 yr old son fiddling around in trying to speed-solve his 2x2 Rubik\\'s cube.  When she said she would have a hard time solving all the colors together, my son put the cube down on the table and said \"DONE\".  Boy did that impress the lady.  She kept calling him genius child.  =)  \\n\\nMy daughters and I each ordered the Bento Box, my son the Child\\'s Bento, and my wife the Nabeyaki Udon soup.  All within reasonable price and the portions were plenty.  My wife complimented that the soup wasn\\'t heavy at all and after taking a taste, I fell in love with the consistency of the Udon (Al dente) and flavor of the broth and ingredients (shitake mushroom, napa cabbage and other goodies).  All the food we ordered was very delicious and satisfying.  Out of all the sushi places we\\'ve tried in the city, I think we finally found our favorite Sushi place and our delicious meals and friendly service summed it all up.  We also noticed a large number of people coming in and out picking up their take-out orders.    \\n\\nWhen the nice lady was about to leave for home, she stopped by back at our table and graciously thanked us for coming by the restaurant that evening.  To our surprise, 3 minutes later, one of the gentlemen came to our table and gave us a full tempura crab sushi roll on the house.  I think this was all in part due to my son putting an impression on the kind lady when he solved the Rubik\\'s cube.  We\\'ve never experienced that level of kindness before.  \\n\\nNot only is the food great here, but it\\'s a plus having them in the neighborhood and just down the street from us.  It\\'s truly a hidden gem indeed.  The people and owners here are very gracious and the atmosphere and energy is very positive.  We\\'ll be back again for years to come.  Please give them a try and I hope you leave impressed as well.', u\"Nice sushi place and the online ordering SO CONVENIENT!\\nLove that!\\n\\nStandard Californian Japanese sushi place! Their Teryaki chicken is good and their sushis too. I've tried it already a dozen of times and they were always fresh.\\n\\nHowever sometimes they seem to give the wrong cut of salmon on their sushis (that is why I don't give 5 stars)\\n\\nI also like their Cali rolls with fake crab meat. They are well made and nicely seasoned. Not overwhelming or breaking apart.\\n\\nWell, it is a nice place to go have lunch if you live/work around!\\n\\nI'll try their rolls one day... Will give an updated review!\\n\\nAlso I wish their online ordering menu was more diversified. It is quite limited.\", u\"I work nearby, across the street to be exact. Came here after work one day with the coworkers desperate for a drink.. the restaurant was closed for their mid-day break but after we asked them if we can just sit at the corner & have a cup of beer, promising that we will not bother them the entire time, they welcomed us in with open arms.  \\nSuper friendly and funny staff.\\n\\nIts a small ma+pops place & trust me, they make u feel like you're at your own grandma&pops place. The woman is the sweetest & cutest thing ever. And the man who works behind the counter doesn't fall short behind her.\\n\\nAside from their wonderful services, the sushi there is amazing. I got the 2 item bento box with hamachi & salmon sashimi & both the fish were extremely fresh & savory. It literally melted in my mouth.\\n\\nDef my to-go place for outings during lunch break or afterwork (even tho I wished that they were open between the hours of 4-5 as well since thats when I get off of work heh.\", u'Love joy sushi. Friendly service, fresh sushi, and big serving sizes. Also check in for the free green tea ice cream! :)', u'Really good food for a cheap price, at least for lunch, and large portions.  Everyone at the table got a bento box with soup, salad, rice, and two entree items. They also threw in a free dessert! When I unlocked the green tea ice cream, the whole table got it!\\n\\nVery friendly staff and good service. The owner made sure to come up to us and start conversation and asked questions.', u\"My first experience couldn't have been better! The food is delicious, the roll sizes are considerably big and there are many different options in the menu. Very friendly service too.\\nDon't expect a fancy or cool restaurant, but the food is definitely 5 stars!\", u'The restaurant is tiny and was pretty busy when we went for lunch. I tried a bento box with chicken teriyaki and tonkotsu. The chicken was good but the tonkotsu was a bit overcooked. The sushi looked better so maybe I will try that next time. This is a great spot for some Japanese if you want to avoid downtown crowds.', u\"Friendly service and good sushi! They have a good variety of cooked and uncooked rolls which makes it hard to choose which one to try first since they all look scrumptious! The Samurai roll was absolutely delicious! It contains salmon, tuna, imitation crab, and other good stuff. The Unagi nigiri is super yummy but smaller than other restaurants. I choose quality over quantity any day when it comes to Sushi! I'll definitely be back here. I'll just be indecisive on which roll to choose next!\", u\"Now my favorite Japanese restaurant in the area.  Their sushi and sashimi is fresh and delicious, and the chirashi is plentiful and has a fantastic selection.  But my very favorite dishes there are actually all hot foods and appetizers.  The salmon and hamachi kama are done just right and come with a great dipping sauce, the grilled squid is fantastic, they have potato croquettes, and there's a lightly-cooked ahi tuna appetizer that is so yummy.  And it's all pretty inexpensive compared to some of the other places around here!  \\n\\nOnly thing to watch out for is they sometimes forget that you ordered some items.  But if you remind them that you haven't gotten stuff yet, they'll hurry and make them for you.  Given how yummy their food is, I think it's totally worth putting up with.\", u\"Ate here for dinner tonight for the first time and we left very happy! Neither my boyfriend or I eat fish but love Japanese food. We had two different veggie rolls, the potsticker roll, and chicken teriyaki roll. They were all delicious, especially the potsticker roll which had a nice little crunch to it. The place was clean and all the staff were very attentive and friendly. We were given a free tempura seaweed appetizer as an apology for the food taking too long which was really nice of them, but we didn't think it was taking long at all! We will be back for sure!\\n\\nI also like that their menu includes pictures of all the different rolls. They all looked so amazing that I may even be ambitious next time and try something with crab and shrimp :) we'll see!\", u\"Don't go here expecting a 3-star experience - it will be either 4 or 2. Staff is always nice - though there seems to be lots of turnover. Manager / Sushi chef is awesome and very accommodating. We are semi-regulars and would go more if the food was more consistent.\", u\"This is my favorite place in town. Small little joint but everyone is friendly and they know their regulars. The fish is always fresh. Great selection of rolls. They are closed Sunday's though. I come here all the time and the sushi is great everytime!\", u'This is an decent sushi place, might not seem that way from outside. I have been coming here almost every week for the last year, and left happy every time. There is soup and salad that comes with most orders. The staff is really nice every time, especially he manager lady. Always comes out to greet everyone. There is always plenty of parking.', u\"Super friendly. Not too expensive and decent Sushi. My kids love this place. They have deep fried seaweed appetizer that's nice and the Inari is very good.\", u\"This is my favorite place for sushi. I have not had a single thing there that I haven't loved. The staff are wonderful (except for the older lady that rushes you when it is busy. She can be a bit rude).\\n\\nThey recently updated the menus which are very nice now. The pictures are accurate and have numbered recommendations for the most popular items (which is a helpful way to pick something new to try).\\n\\nThe only drawback is this place is very small... And busy, so you hit the lunch rush you are either packed in like sardines and rushed, or waiting outside in a line. I am inclined to take a star off for that, but the food is worth it.\\n\\nOne last thing... I like that they use better quality chopsticks that don't splinter.\", u\"Joy is conveniently located very close to my office, so I have lots of coworkers that go here and rave about the food and speed. I was quite sceptical on my first visit because I believe I've already found the south bay gold standard for sushi (Mizu) and didn't know if I'd like anything less.\\n\\nI'd say my first visit was a 4-star experience. I got a lunch bento box, which was a lot of food and the sashimi was excellent quality and tasted great. I got in and out within an hour, so it definitely met my requirements.\\n\\nMy next visit I decided to go with rolls instead; the Lambada and the Cherry Blossom were my choices to gorge myself over lunch. They were fresh, well rolled, and had a good ratio of rice to fish. They also brought around a complimentary roll (that I didn't eat), which I thought was really cool. Again, a 4-star experience.\\n\\nUnfortunately, upon subsequent visits, I've had issues. The overall service is inconsistent; there are some times they're very attentive, and there are some times they don't pay attention to you or bring you another bill right after you've paid. Also, I've had an instance where the quality of my Lambada roll wasn't very good ... they stuck off-color bits with skin still on in the middle.

It's totally worth it, though! Yum!\", u\"This place is a nice place to eat at if you want to avoid the craziness that is Castro parking. The fish isn't of the best quality, but I must say the service is excellent, and the food is pretty well priced for the portions they give you.\\n\\nWith dinner, everyone is given a bowl of miso soup and a salad, and sometimes the woman who works there (maybe the owner?) comes by with free seaweed tempura which is very nice.\\n\\nThe sashimi is pretty solid and well priced (may be frozen before, idk but still tasty) and all of the rolls are huge.\", u'Love this place. It has the roll I can never find anywhere. I just want a cali roll with shrimp tempura inside and then salmon on top. The 1st roll is all I need and it makes me oh so happy. Please go and find me a place that has those exact things.', u\"Ordered: sake/hamachi sashimi, tempura, lobster roll, and giant roll\\nWhat to order: sashimi, giant roll\\n\\nDefinitely planning to head back to this place to try the other rolls/entrees. The service was great and we even got free tempura fried seaweed! Miso soup and a salad often comes with whatever you're order. It's a lot of food btdubs.\\n\\nSashimi - for 8 slices, we got it for $10, which is really good. I think they should have left it out for a bit more, since you could tell that toward the core of the slice, that it was previously frozen. Nevertheless, it didn't detract away from the texture and taste of the fish after we finished our rolls.\\n\\nTempura - standard.\\n\\nLobster roll - there's this weird candied mango sauce on top of it. Aside from that, pretty good.\\n\\nGiant roll - we just wanted some eel in the mix.\", u\"For $9-$10 lunch bentos this place is a steal!.  The 2 item bentos are pretty good for the price.  They come with a sufficient amount of food at a decent quality.  The sashimi they serve here is huge!  I haven't had a chance to try their sushi yet, but I may in the future.  They also take orders via an app called Order Ahead so if you're just doing pickup, its a breeze.  This is a great lunch spot though, but be careful it does get fairly busy around noon on weekdays.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nIf you want to use their order ahead service, make sure you specify the sauces you want.  The first time I got my tonkatsu sauce, the second time I didn't... It feels so incomplete, I wish they had been more conscious about that.  Also the first time, it was pork tonkatsu, the second time it was beef tonkatsu.  Consistency guys...  I'd be tempted to drop it to a 2 star, but I still like the place for the most part, the dine-in service is great, just make sure you beware if you're doing takeout\\n\\nUpdate #2:\\nI really like your food, but jeez get my order right with the takeout.  I specifically instructed to get the tonkatsu sauce which I got in my order this time, however they forgot the soy sauce for my sushi...  I think I'll have to draw a picture next time...\", u\"Really good sushi in a tiny place in the middle of corporate Mountain View. My boss loves this place and so we came here for one of our lunches. I had the veg mix roll and Bay Bridge roll since I was vegetarian for a month. They were both good, and really good portions too! I'd definitely come back!\", u\"I've had better - the California rolls had too much mayo for me and the salmon hand roll was skin not meat as the menu stated.\", u'Wonderful, fresh, and creative.  Great customer service. 4 of us went last night and stayed for 3 hours and had a wonderful time. Will definitely return.', u\"THE best :)\\n\\nBecause of the great service, I can enjoy my sushi every time I come.\\nI love their food from the salad and to the chirashi!!\\nIt gets packed during lunch, but there's a reason for that, right? :)\\nCan't wait to come back and satisfy my tummy!\", u\"Our server Daniel was phenomenal! He was friendly, prompt, and generous with our service. We came here the day before Christmas Eve and he offered us a free large sake (as long as we promised to drive safely) after finishing our purchased large sake.  Seriously?! I'm not a huge fan of the tipping phenomenon in the states but I'll (try to) tip the crap out of you if you're kind and generous like this guy! We also received a salad and miso soup after ordering 2 rolls, which is pretty uncommon based on the many sushi places I've visited. We cheers'ed with another couple as well as the sushi chef and overall, had fantastic time! I work across the street and rarely come here but would definitely recommend Joy Sushi to anyone in the area. Thanks Daniel and thank you Joy Sushi for the wonderful dinner!!\", u\"Definitely a great place to go eat sushi! not the best of quality but the quaint little family atmosphere was great :)\\n\\nI went here with two of my friends last night just to grab a bite for dinner. I got four rolls (so ambitious).. I got the tuna roll, eel roll, gyoza roll, and foster city roll. I don't recommend the foster city roll and the gyoza roll was better than I thought!\\n\\nThe price is pretty average compared to sushi places. The service was great and the Korean family was really good to be around. I would definitely come back to try the other rolls!\", u\"We live just down the road and this is our go-to sushi spot. Years ago before this location opened up the Mrs. and I would drive up to downtown San Mateo to go to Joy's first location, so needless to say we were pumped when we saw this one open up around the corner. While the prices are comparable to other sushi joints in the area, Joy Sushi's rolls are ENORMOUS and definitely give you more bang for your buck. Salmon Paradise, Baked Lobster, Samurai, and Geisha rolls are favorites of mine, along with the Monster roll (if you're looking for something on the adventurous/deep fried side). If you live in Mountain View/Sunnyvale and love sushi, definitely give this place a try!\", u'I finally was able to take the family to this nice place after trying a few times on my own, but just happened to show-up during closed hours.  I guess 3rd times a charm and boy was it ever.\\n\\nAs soon as we opened the door to walk in for dinner, we were immediately greeted by the gentlemen behind the counter that were preparing the sushi.  After our waiter took our order, the very nice Japanese lady (I think the owner) gracefully greeted us and provided our water.  She was impressed when she saw my 10 yr old son fiddling around in trying to speed-solve his 2x2 Rubik\\'s cube.  When she said she would have a hard time solving all the colors together, my son put the cube down on the table and said \"DONE\".  Boy did that impress the lady.  She kept calling him genius child.  =)  \\n\\nMy daughters and I each ordered the Bento Box, my son the Child\\'s Bento, and my wife the Nabeyaki Udon soup.  All within reasonable price and the portions were plenty.  My wife complimented that the soup wasn\\'t heavy at all and after taking a taste, I fell in love with the consistency of the Udon (Al dente) and flavor of the broth and ingredients (shitake mushroom, napa cabbage and other goodies).  All the food we ordered was very delicious and satisfying.  Out of all the sushi places we\\'ve tried in the city, I think we finally found our favorite Sushi place and our delicious meals and friendly service summed it all up.  We also noticed a large number of people coming in and out picking up their take-out orders.    \\n\\nWhen the nice lady was about to leave for home, she stopped by back at our table and graciously thanked us for coming by the restaurant that evening.  To our surprise, 3 minutes later, one of the gentlemen came to our table and gave us a full tempura crab sushi roll on the house.  I think this was all in part due to my son putting an impression on the kind lady when he solved the Rubik\\'s cube.  We\\'ve never experienced that level of kindness before.  \\n\\nNot only is the food great here, but it\\'s a plus having them in the neighborhood and just down the street from us.  It\\'s truly a hidden gem indeed.  The people and owners here are very gracious and the atmosphere and energy is very positive.  We\\'ll be back again for years to come.  Please give them a try and I hope you leave impressed as well.', u\"Nice sushi place and the online ordering SO CONVENIENT!\\nLove that!\\n\\nStandard Californian Japanese sushi place! Their Teryaki chicken is good and their sushis too. I've tried it already a dozen of times and they were always fresh.\\n\\nHowever sometimes they seem to give the wrong cut of salmon on their sushis (that is why I don't give 5 stars)\\n\\nI also like their Cali rolls with fake crab meat. They are well made and nicely seasoned. Not overwhelming or breaking apart.\\n\\nWell, it is a nice place to go have lunch if you live/work around!\\n\\nI'll try their rolls one day... Will give an updated review!\\n\\nAlso I wish their online ordering menu was more diversified. It is quite limited.\", u\"I work nearby, across the street to be exact. Came here after work one day with the coworkers desperate for a drink.. the restaurant was closed for their mid-day break but after we asked them if we can just sit at the corner & have a cup of beer, promising that we will not bother them the entire time, they welcomed us in with open arms.  \\nSuper friendly and funny staff.\\n\\nIts a small ma+pops place & trust me, they make u feel like you're at your own grandma&pops place. The woman is the sweetest & cutest thing ever. And the man who works behind the counter doesn't fall short behind her.\\n\\nAside from their wonderful services, the sushi there is amazing. I got the 2 item bento box with hamachi & salmon sashimi & both the fish were extremely fresh & savory. It literally melted in my mouth.\\n\\nDef my to-go place for outings during lunch break or afterwork (even tho I wished that they were open between the hours of 4-5 as well since thats when I get off of work heh.\", u'Love joy sushi. Friendly service, fresh sushi, and big serving sizes. Also check in for the free green tea ice cream! :)', u'Really good food for a cheap price, at least for lunch, and large portions.  Everyone at the table got a bento box with soup, salad, rice, and two entree items. They also threw in a free dessert! When I unlocked the green tea ice cream, the whole table got it!\\n\\nVery friendly staff and good service. The owner made sure to come up to us and start conversation and asked questions.', u\"My first experience couldn't have been better! The food is delicious, the roll sizes are considerably big and there are many different options in the menu. Very friendly service too.\\nDon't expect a fancy or cool restaurant, but the food is definitely 5 stars!\", u'The restaurant is tiny and was pretty busy when we went for lunch. I tried a bento box with chicken teriyaki and tonkotsu. The chicken was good but the tonkotsu was a bit overcooked. The sushi looked better so maybe I will try that next time. This is a great spot for some Japanese if you want to avoid downtown crowds.', u\"Friendly service and good sushi! They have a good variety of cooked and uncooked rolls which makes it hard to choose which one to try first since they all look scrumptious! The Samurai roll was absolutely delicious! It contains salmon, tuna, imitation crab, and other good stuff. The Unagi nigiri is super yummy but smaller than other restaurants. I choose quality over quantity any day when it comes to Sushi! I'll definitely be back here. I'll just be indecisive on which roll to choose next!\", u\"Now my favorite Japanese restaurant in the area.  Their sushi and sashimi is fresh and delicious, and the chirashi is plentiful and has a fantastic selection.  But my very favorite dishes there are actually all hot foods and appetizers.  The salmon and hamachi kama are done just right and come with a great dipping sauce, the grilled squid is fantastic, they have potato croquettes, and there's a lightly-cooked ahi tuna appetizer that is so yummy.  And it's all pretty inexpensive compared to some of the other places around here!  \\n\\nOnly thing to watch out for is they sometimes forget that you ordered some items.  But if you remind them that you haven't gotten stuff yet, they'll hurry and make them for you.  Given how yummy their food is, I think it's totally worth putting up with.\", u\"Ate here for dinner tonight for the first time and we left very happy! Neither my boyfriend or I eat fish but love Japanese food. We had two different veggie rolls, the potsticker roll, and chicken teriyaki roll. They were all delicious, especially the potsticker roll which had a nice little crunch to it. The place was clean and all the staff were very attentive and friendly. We were given a free tempura seaweed appetizer as an apology for the food taking too long which was really nice of them, but we didn't think it was taking long at all! We will be back for sure!\\n\\nI also like that their menu includes pictures of all the different rolls. They all looked so amazing that I may even be ambitious next time and try something with crab and shrimp :) we'll see!\", u\"Don't go here expecting a 3-star experience - it will be either 4 or 2. Staff is always nice - though there seems to be lots of turnover. Manager / Sushi chef is awesome and very accommodating. We are semi-regulars and would go more if the food was more consistent.\", u\"This is my favorite place in town. Small little joint but everyone is friendly and they know their regulars. The fish is always fresh. Great selection of rolls. They are closed Sunday's though. I come here all the time and the sushi is great everytime!\", u'This is an decent sushi place, might not seem that way from outside. I have been coming here almost every week for the last year, and left happy every time. There is soup and salad that comes with most orders. The staff is really nice every time, especially he manager lady. Always comes out to greet everyone. There is always plenty of parking.', u\"Super friendly. Not too expensive and decent Sushi. My kids love this place. They have deep fried seaweed appetizer that's nice and the Inari is very good.\", u\"This is my favorite place for sushi. I have not had a single thing there that I haven't loved. The staff are wonderful (except for the older lady that rushes you when it is busy. She can be a bit rude).\\n\\nThey recently updated the menus which are very nice now. The pictures are accurate and have numbered recommendations for the most popular items (which is a helpful way to pick something new to try).\\n\\nThe only drawback is this place is very small... And busy, so you hit the lunch rush you are either packed in like sardines and rushed, or waiting outside in a line. I am inclined to take a star off for that, but the food is worth it.\\n\\nOne last thing... I like that they use better quality chopsticks that don't splinter.\", u\"Joy is conveniently located very close to my office, so I have lots of coworkers that go here and rave about the food and speed. I was quite sceptical on my first visit because I believe I've already found the south bay gold standard for sushi (Mizu) and didn't know if I'd like anything less.\\n\\nI'd say my first visit was a 4-star experience. I got a lunch bento box, which was a lot of food and the sashimi was excellent quality and tasted great. I got in and out within an hour, so it definitely met my requirements.\\n\\nMy next visit I decided to go with rolls instead; the Lambada and the Cherry Blossom were my choices to gorge myself over lunch. They were fresh, well rolled, and had a good ratio of rice to fish. They also brought around a complimentary roll (that I didn't eat), which I thought was really cool. Again, a 4-star experience.\\n\\nUnfortunately, upon subsequent visits, I've had issues. The overall service is inconsistent; there are some times they're very attentive, and there are some times they don't pay attention to you or bring you another bill right after you've paid. Also, I've had an instance where the quality of my Lambada roll wasn't very good ... they stuck off-color bits with skin still on in the middle. While I realize there may be other sushi places that do that, it's not the practice of a 4 or 5 star sushi place.\\n\\nLong story short, it's a 3-star place that I think is worth going to, but inconsistent.\", u'This place is tucked away in the back of a small strip mall at Whisman and Middlefield,  I had no idea it was  there (despite the fact that I drive by that area almost daily.)  We stopped in for dinner Friday evening.   It seats about 25 people.   Very casual, service with a smile (the lady who helped serve our meal was delightful).   They start you off with complimentary fried (Tempura)  Seaweed which was yummy.   We tried mackerel (very good)  chicken teriyaki (good)  and an order of Gyoza (fanastic).   Based on reviews I would try a couple of their rolls next time, but cost was reasonable, for two drinks (beer/wine)  and all the items mentioned it was around $40.   Definitely will be back.  \\n\\nWe took a look at the catering menu,  they offer a variety of platters that looked delectable and very reasonably priced, great idea for a party at home or at the office.', u'Beaf rice to go and chicken rice to go are not of the same amount!\\nWe complained by phone and took pics, but they still insist they are the same!\\nLiars!', u\"A hidden gem of Silicon Valley. *_*\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Complimentary starter: fried tempura seaweed with salsa. This is the equivalent of chips and salsa but a MILLION times better.\\n+ We got free miso soup and Japanese salad!\\n+ Vast menu.\\n+ We ordered the Sunshine Roll (VERY good; fresh), Baked Lobster Roll (delicious but heavy), Lava Roll (okay; huge proportions), Crispy Roll (big; hard to eat but didn't fall apart), and Vegi Mix Roll (nice and different; loved the sweet potato).\\n+ Fairly good seating for such a small restaurant.\\n+ This shopping plaza seems to be the closest set of restaurants to the Hacker Dojo. If you're at Hacker Dojo for an event, Joy Sushi is a great place to dine afterwards!\\n+ Good prices. Most special rolls were ~$10.\\n+ Large proportions.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Location is hard to find. It's not visible from the street. It's tucked in a corner of the between a Thai massage parlor and a Chinese fast-food restaurant.\\n- Some rolls were really good, while others were just okay. The baked rolls here seemed a bit heavy.\", u'Did pickup the other day, phone was picked up with no real delay, ordering was easy...pick-up was ready when I arrived :)', u\"Awesome restaurant!!! Great service by the cool Korean guy named Bong Jun! He is really helpful and great commutation skills he has. He always has a smile on and cracks joke Around!  loved the food too they gave free miso soup which I got like 3 times for FREE some places don't give it for free but they do! People should go visit this place\", u\"Came here for dinner with a friend since I had previously purchased a Yelp deal! The restaurant is quite cozy, one of the smaller sushi joints I've been to. It was a pretty slow night. I think they may have about 10 tables but it was just us and another table. We were greeted and seated immediately and our waitress asked what we'd like to drink. My friend and I got tea and water. Then she brought our complimentary miso soup and salad! The soup was average, I had three pieces of tofu and one piece of seaweed. The salad was premixed with dressing, heavy on the dressing.\\n\\nWe ordered the mixed tempura, lobster roll, island roll & joy king roll. I was so excited to try the lobster roll because some of the other reviewers had mentioned it was amazing but it was just okay to me. It was way over sauced, it overwhelmed the roll for me. The island roll was good though, it felt like a lighter version. The joy king roll, which is baked, was like the lion king roll at other places. It was actually the smallest roll of the three. I felt like there wasn't enough sauce on that one, the salmon was kind of dry. I can't really tell how fresh the fish was because of all the sauces. The mixed tempura was just alright, it had much more breading than I'm used to having at sushi places so I found it to be extremely filling.\\n\\nI was STARVING when we finally got here. My GPS was giving me issues so it took awhile to get here. When our food was brought out, we realized that it was way too much for us! The island and lobster rolls were 8 pieces each! The joy king roll had 6 pieces. Then we had 6 pieces in our mixed tempura! We ended up only eating half and took the rest home.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice, she checked up on us several times, gave us extra ginger & refilled our tea. I understood that it was slow but I felt a bit uncomfortable with her standing so close to us (we sat near the kitchen/bar area) while she was checking on what I presumed was her phone. It was nice to try a new sushi place but I'm not sure I would come back. Maybe lunch would be worth a shot if I'm ever in the area. To recap, good for big rolls and freebies but that's pretty much it.\", u'I usually get salmon teriyaki and the portions are a good size for what you pay. The food here is delicious and I like the variety of what they offer. Only downside is that the place is small with limited seating but the food makes up for it. Plus the staff is friendly.', u\"Pro's-\\nReally good salmon sashimi\\nBento was decent\\nMiso soup and salad included\\n\\nCons-\\nCherry roll started tasting cheap (like a roll you buy at a grocery store)\\nService was pretty bad and slow, although friendly\\nNever had my water refilled\\nGetting the check and then receiving it back took close to 20+ mins\\n\\nWish I could say I was coming back considering it's next to all my other lunch stops, but it's not likely.\", u\"tried this tonight for the first time in a couple of years.  sushi is outstanding, as good as i've had and i lived in japan for 4 years. the fish extended well over each end of the sushi rice.  fish seemed very fresh, delicious. service was impeccable. my new favorite sushi spot.\", u'I have been coming to joy sushi for 2 years! Honestly, the elder lady that works there is so friendly and very sweet! Our orders are always received under 30min and done perfectly every time! Dragon roll was always my favorite. Sometimes they give us free treats \"on the house\" and they have so many selections on the menu with pictures!  dont know why it has 3 1/2 stars rating but this is totally the type of sushi place id go when im hungry.', u\"Excellent sushi and bento box was a lot of food and very tasty. I had the shirt rib and spicy chicken. Service is fast and courteous even though we brought a 3 month old baby. I'm definitely making Joy my new sushi goto place.\"]"

This location is pretty small but they work fast and you can be in and out in 5 minutes.\\n\\nJust tried the new Sriracha steak melt and it was delicious.  The steak might not be the best steak like Alexanders or Flemming's but its acceptable for a fast food chain.  They put the right about of Sriracha to give it a kick but not overpower the steak.  I seriously recommend this one with your favorite toppings.\", u'Nice staff, very polite. Clean place. But I had to look hard to see the meat on my sandwich.

However, by having this freedom, customer service and friendliness are often dismissed at these types of locations.\\n\\nAs I have worked at retail food stores, I understand the need to rush, and the need to follow company procedures. But it does not excuse the demeanor of the workers their attitudes towards customers.\\n\\nI went in at 1:30PM, no line. 4 or 5 workers behind the glass. Girl in front does not greet, no smile, \"What do you want..\" That was the only thing she said. Then she looks at the next person with even more of a disgusted look and repeats... definitely not creating that customer experience you\\'d expect from a major vendor.\\n\\nWas I done with this portion of the order? Do I wait for you to put the rest on? Maybe it\\'s just this one worker... maybe she had a bad day. I decided to stay positive and polite.\\n\\nNext worker: toasted and heated my sandwich, and put toppings on. I have to say that this guy stingy as hell. I\\'ve never gotten a sandwich from subways as thin as this one. I asked for onions, he put 6 scant pieces. I asked for more, he put 2 more. He started wrapping the sandwich when i asked \"doesn\\'t that get chipotle sauce?\" (as i had gotten the new CHIPOTLE steak and cheese sandwich). he simply keeps wrapping and asks \"oh you wanted chipotle sauce?\"\\n\\nI felt as though they were taking advantage of my being nice. If i had been rude maybe they\\'d been more attentive?\\n\\nPerhaps it was a bad day and something happened in the store.

What can I say? Every once in awhile you just feel like a sandwich on your way home from the gym.\\n\\nI\\'d have to say their menu is starting to get more and more confusing. There\\'s only a limited amount of sandwiches that \"advertise\" as the $5 footlong. Sometimes I just end up standing there looking at the menu for so long.', u\"This place has consistenly been good for the years I have been going to it.

There was a long line but I stepped up to it and was ready to wait. It took less than 5 minutes to get my sandwich. I was in awe the whole time.

While making my new sandwich she constantly tried to put stuff on it that I did not ask for.\\n\\nThey did not follow my wife's instructions either putting things not ordered on her sandwich and missing items ordered.\\n\\nThe cause of this you may ask?

I\\'ve been here about 8 times now, and I\\'m not sure if I\\'ll go again. Our orders are frequently messed up, and the food quality is not good enough to warrant giving Vive Sol another try. When it\\'s good, it\\'s really, really good. But, unfortunately this is too rare.\\n\\nOn our last visit, we began by ordering the Coctelde Camaron and the Ceviche as appetizers. Both were warm (not chilled), and bland. Both were very disappointing and remained unfinished. Side note: I recently purchases some cerviche from Costco, which was significantly better than the one from Vive Sol. Now, that\\'s just not right! Costco sets a pretty good standard, however any restaurant should surpass the Costco standard, because restaurants specialize in \"food\" and \"meals\". Anyway, after the disappointing appetizers, our main course orders were messed up again!\\n\\nIf Vive Sol was consistent with it\\'s high quality, I\\'d give it 5 stars. But, it\\'s just too inconsistent.\\n\\nIn summary: Food = average: Staff = average.', u\"Anyone remotely near the Bay Area needs to visit Vive Sol -- hands down the best chile rellenos I have ever eaten in my entire life!\\n\\nI used to make chile rellenos from scratch -- a culinary endeavor that requires a good amount of patience and time -- and these taste even better than homemade!\\n\\nThey are as fluffy as a cloud and so incredibly tender that every time I eat them I want to eat them for every meal the rest of my life.\\n\\nI have even had foodie dreams about eating at this restaurant. That's how good it is!\\n\\nThe margaritas are on deck and the salsa trio with chips is excellent as well\\n\\nKeep up the good work!! Please open a location in Orange County!!!\", u\"I have lived in the Bay Area most of my life, save a few years living away from home.\\nWIth Vive Sol right on the El Camino, I have driven past the little place for years. Set back from the El Camino a bit, and with the front pretty tiny and unassuming, Vive Sol is a hidden gem! My partner and I looooove Mexican food. And we love eating out at fun places. While doing a Yelp search for margaritas, my favirite drink, Vive Sol jumped on my radar. Out of nowhere.\\nVive Sol. Really? It always looked like this dinky tiny little place. But it has been here for a while. With rent prices skyrocketing, it has to be good to last.\\nLooked at the menu. A little on the pricey side, but when we have a few extra bucks in our pocket, we have no problem splurging on a place with good reviews on their food and drinks.\\nDecor is a little odd. Mismatched. But you aren't here for that.\\nIt's all about the food.\\nHad the combo enchiladas and margaritas. Sauces on the enchiladas were amazing. Margaritas were top notch.\\nCan't see us coming back here too often, because of the prices, but when it's time for a special occasion, Vive Sol is on the list!\", u'Slow service, different prices on different food and drink menus, and mysterious liquor upcharges on the bill. I feel cheated.\\n\\nLet me give you the couple of upsides to this place before going into all that is wrong with it.\\n-Nice hostesses, friendly (but slow and mostly absent waiter) and nice decor. The rest was pretty poor.\\n\\n4 of us went there for dinner. We were seated, the busboy brought chips and salsa and a bottle of water-- he didn\\'t pour it into our glasses--just sat the bottle on the table, he didn\\'t acknowledge us or smile, he just dropped stuff off and walked away.\\n\\nSo we read the menus and waited for a waiter. The first thing we noticed was the all of the items on my wife\\'s menu were $1 less than the rest of out menus. OK I guess they neglected to get rid of the old menus, not a biggie. (But wait, it\\'s a pattern here!)\\n\\nSo we continued to sit and wait for a waiter...5 minutes go by, 10 minutes go by, 15 minutes go by and no one has even looked in our direction or acknowledged us, no one even close enough or paying enough attention for us to flag them down.\\n\\nI saw a lady leaning against a wall and waved her over. I asked if anyone was going to wait on us. She didn\\'t seem to know so I asked her to find out and to please get us a pitcher of margaritas while we wait. She mumbled something which I couldn\\'t understand and walked away and never came back so I didn\\'t know if the margaritas were on the way or not.\\n\\nAnd so we continued to wait...now it\\'s 20 minutes with no waiter and no drinks, the bottle of water has long been empty and nobody comes to give us more water.\\n\\nFINALLY, 25 MINUTES AFTER WE SAT DOWN, a cheery waiter comes up and asks how we\\'re doing. I said half joking but firmly, \"we\\'ve been waiting 25 minutes and still haven\\'t placed an order nor gotten anything to drink.\" Just then a pitcher of margaritas arrived. FINALLY!!!!\\n\\nTo save time I won\\'t write down ALL of the stuff that went wrong, but let me just say this about the continuing service...he was always friendly and we were always friendly to him but it always seemed like he was in a rush to get somewhere else. Once the margaritas arrived he walked away before we could order. Then he came back later and we finally got to order an appetizer and tried to give him our main course orders but he walked away again. Finally, literally 35 minutes after sitting down we got to give him our order.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nMeh. Really underwhelming. No flavor. Costs 30%-40% than any of 100 other Mexican restaurants in the area that have better food.\\n\\nTHE BILL:\\nFinally we\\'re finished and get the bill. Hmmm...$40 for a pitcher of margaritas. We had two so it was $80 for two pitchers of margaritas. Odd because the only pitcher of margaritas on the drink menu *that I received* said they were $30 each. (Which is already several dollars over-priced compared to comparable restaurants.) So I go to the hostess stand and grab another drink menu and the price on it says $33, not $30 like my menu said--more pricing inconsistency just like the food menus.\\n\\nWe asked the guy handling the bill why we got charged $40 when the menu said $30 and/or $33. He asked \"what did you say when you ordered?\" And I said \"please bring me a pitcher of margaritas\" (because there was only one pitcher on my menu.) And he says \"no, if you order a pitcher of margaritas then we give you this one\"...pointing on the menu to a GLASS of top shelf margaritas, which does not have a pitcher price. So wait, we order the only pitcher of margaritas on the menu and you decide that it\\'s OK to charge us $10 more than it says on the menu? Not cool.\\n\\nSo to sum it all up...slooooooowwwwwww service...we get different menus with different food prices on them, we never get water refilled, food is bland and way over-priced, we are given a drink menu, we order from that menu and we get charged $10 more than is on the menu for each pitcher for some mysterious hidden premium pitcher of margaritas.\\n\\nBasically I feel like they bent me over and stuck it to me. Never again. Stay away!!!', u\"Came here for my first time the other day.\\n\\nWe were greeted nicely at the door and seated promptly. Our server was courteous and always made we had water and fresh chips and salsa at the table!\\n\\nMy friend and I had their house margarita and habanero margarita. Both were delicious with a decent amount of tequila inside.\\n\\nI had their enchilada with mol\\xe9 sauce, and I was so pleased with how it turned out. Their mol\\xe9 is rich, creamy and delicious!\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place to a friend and plan on going back soon!\\n\\nOnly bad part we didn't enjoy was the jerk that decided to block us in our parking spot. Not sure why employees didn't seem to mind the random parking in the middle of the lot with no spots that ended up blocking customers in, but they let it happen. My friend had to complete a 87 point turn through bushes to get out. That was annoying, but besides that, we had a good experience.\", u\"We came here for work lunch, and the food is amazing. I got the guajilla chicken (not the enchilada), and it was really good! The service was good too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that Yelp says they don't take reservations, and we were a big group so I got there early to get a table. They asked if I have a reservation.. Whatttt, I should've called and confirmed but I just believed what it said on Yelp so I didn't. Not a problem though, we were  seated with a short wait in the patio, so that was good!\", u\"I would have never found this place if my colleague had not mentioned it. It's on El Camino but its tucked inside a bit. They have a decent sized parking lot. The restaurant has a nice and clean ambiance.\\n\\nFood and service is pretty good too. It does get pretty crowded during peak hour so get in early or reserve a table ahead.\", u\"We were looking for a sit down Mexican restaurant and Vive Sol fit the bill. On a Saturday night it seemed really crowded - we were lucky to wait & get 1 parking space that opened, and it looked packed inside - but we were pleasantly surprised to be told there would only be a 10 minute wait for a table, which turned out to be only five minutes or so.\\n\\nOverall I was happy with the food. The menu was slightly limited in some ways - most of it was burritos and enchiladas, and I couldn't tell the differences among all of the options, which weren't fully described. However, the soups also looked interesting and some of the specials were a bit more unique. The enchiladas were quite good, and I liked the rice and beans as well. The chile colorado (called Sonora here) was excellent. The chips & salsa were more mediocre, and the latter is given out in piddling amounts. But we'd definitely come back for the main courses!\", u\"I've dined in a couple of times, love the ambiance. Mostly I get their chicken soups when I am hungover and they are fantastic :P\", u\"Cute place, great ambiance. In the evening, the sunlight shines in warmly through the windows. I love it.\\n\\nI got one of the server's recommendations - two enchiladas: one chicken with red sauce and one pork with green sauce. Both were tasty, but next time I'd get two chicken enchiladas. The chicken meat was very tender and juicy. The sauces were delicious. The rice and beans were so good that it was hard to stop eating them even when I was full.  I also filled up on their delicious chips and salsa.\\n\\nThis is one of my favorite Mexican places in Mountain View!\", u'OMG. Deliciousness. I am a bean and rice fanatic... and by fanatic, I mean every meal could be Mexican food and I would be happy. I have tried some of what would be called \"the best Mexican restaurants in the Bay Area\" and this by far is my favorite.\\n\\nThe margartias are made to perfection. None of that cheap margarita mix crap, these are made with all the right, fresh ingredients... My favorite thing is definitely the Grandma\\'s sauce... It\\'s like heaven in your mouth. Mini orgasms with every bite.\\n\\nAnd HOLY GUACAMOLE. Literally. It\\'s holy its ssooooo freaking good.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and eat here. Eat here every day. Crap, I want to eat there now... Maybe I will have to stop this review so I can go eat there... yumm. food.', u\"I absolutely dislike Vive Sol in Palo Alto, so I was wary of checking this one out, but I'm so glad I did! I've been so many times since then, and I always enjoy it. Their chips and salsa are yummy, but their chips aren't as fresh and crispy as other places.\\n\\nI have tried various combinations for dinner, but my favorite is the cheese and onion enchilada with red sauce/ veggie tostada. I also like the enfrijoladas- the grilled veggie enchiladas topped with a black bean sauce. So unique and delicious, but I hesitate to order that more often because it doesn't come with rice :(\\n\\nMinus one star because of their ridiculously petty pricing- I came with my family and my dad asked if they could make his dish spicy. The waiter said sure, he could give us some green chillies with the dish. When the bill came, they had charged something crazy like $4 for a tiny bowl of chopped chillies... I could head over to India Cash & Carry and BUY $4 of chillies that would last me over a month.\\n\\nWould I come back? Yup, I always do :)\", u\"Nice outdoor seating and has wood carved mirrors, metal lanterns and that type of decor which makes for a cozy atmosphere. I went against my usual rule of sticking with beer when I don't know the margarita situation and was sorely disappointed. $33 pitcher that probably consisted of an entire bottle of sweet&sour and four shots of tequila which barely put a dent in the mix. Sickly sweet. Had to ask for a bunch of lime wedges just to try to add some acidity still barely finished half. Big waste of money. The food is OK but overpriced. $15.50 for two enchiladas, beans and rice and when I asked for sour cream I was told I'd be charged another $1.50 . Go for the atmosphere and beer. Then go get food at the taco truck down the street which smelled amazing.\", u'Had a great meal in this Mountain View restaurant!\\n\\nThe food was unexpected, really savory but not hot allowing you to really enjoy the meld of the flavors.  There are good and non-traditional choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians.\\n\\nWhen the weather is good they have a lovely outside area where you can sit and enjoy live music. They will also change things up for you if ask...we had one person with a double order of beans (instead of beans and rice) and one with a double rice, both at no extra charge.', u\"First, the decor of this place is awesome! beautiful bar in the front and a dinning room lit with candles and a mix of very nice mix of the restaurant in the back and the bar in the front for the waiting area.\\n\\nSecond, parking is a bit challenging here. There are about 10 total spots for cars and then street parking right of El Camino. I'd advise getting something on the street because it is just a pain to do anything back in their parking area.\\n\\nThird, their chips and salsa combination is amazing! one of my favorite in the bay area. Chips are flakey by strong and the salsa's are mixed with medium to medium/hot. Their Guac is really really good! One of my favorite overall and for less than $9 it's not a bad deal overall.\\n\\nI usually order anything with grandma's old recipe sauce also know as Al Guajillo it's a mix of creamy with more of a chipotle spicy type of sauce. I usually get it with Enchiladas chicken, but I have also had it vegetarian style and it is kick ass as well! My wife prefers the Mole sauce which is more of a spicy earthy like sauce for her enchiladas.\\n\\nIf you are big into drinking their margs are a powerful kick in the face! I prefer starting with one of those and shifting to a beer because not only do they taste great, they will get you going pretty quickly. Two of the margs and I'd advise grabbing an Uber for the ride home.\", u'On the plus side: superior service, very good food, and the wine was great.\\nOn the negative side: bathrooms are outside of the restaurant and it was quite loud. At times I really had to raise my voice to be heard at my table.', u\"Vive Sol is an adorable restaurant set off El Camino and if you don't know it's there you'd never notice it by just driving by.  My sister recommended it as a cute, authentic Mexican restaurant and that's exactly what it is!\\n\\nThey brought out 3 different types of salsa with the chips ranging from mild, medium, to spicy.  They were each delicious in their own unique ways.\\n\\nI brought my children, ages 8 and 12 here.  They were the only children in the restaurant and while this is more of an adult-only setting, older, mature children can do well.  Just don't expect a children's menu.  One child ordered a quesadilla and the other nachos.  Both were delicious.  I ordered the Tampequina.  I wanted to order something different from what I usually get and I'm glad I did.  The sauce on the steak was somewhat sweet and not what I was expecting.  We had to request the nachos and Tampequina to be boxed up and taken home it was so much food.  And they are incredibly generous with the guacamole!  I don't think I've ever seen so much guacamole served for 2 people before!\\n\\nThe server was incredibly nice and attentive.\\n\\nWe sat inside, but the outside was really neat.  At least I *THINK* the outside is...it wasn't attached to the restaurant, rather on the other side of the alley way that leads to the parking lot.  Also, the restrooms were outside, which was a bit unusual.\\n\\nThe only downside I saw was that despite a decent sized parking lot, it was PACKED.  I was lucky to pull up just as a car was pulling out and snagged the only available space.\\n\\n5 stars and I will definitely be returning.\", u'Always a pleasure coming here. My favorite mexican place in the world.... Seriously. Primavera the host is super nice along side a girl I did not know.\\n\\nThe servers are excellent. ( I could be biased because 3 of my cousins work there)\\nValentine the bartender is my favorite!\\nI always get the enchiladas sol. Red sauce is absolutely the BEST but I also love the nueva sauce ( creamy chipotle sauce) and the guajillo sauce ( cream sauce).\\n\\nMargaritas are out of this world and the pollo negro ( chicken breast in a creamy white wine sauce that lays on a bed of spinach sprinkled with goat cheese) is unlike anything you will ever taste.\\n\\nEverything on the menu is Stellar. If you ever in the red wood city area opt for quinto sol one of the sister restaurants.', u'Hands down in my top two favorite Mexican restaurants of the bay area.  I always get the Enchiladas Al Sol and am never disappointed.  The mole is super rich with a great chocolate flavor, so for those who like their mole to be a little less rich, probably not the best option for you.  However, when you mix the mole with the red sauce from the other enchilada, you go to flavor heaven! The habanero margarita is super delicious and they give you three salsas to start which is always great.  Recommend for sure!', u'The parking here is super difficult, especially if you come during dinner crowds. Their parking lot is NOT big enough for their crowds. Good news is you can probably find street parking on the same block, but it can be a long walk/search.\\n\\nMy friends and I came on a Friday evening, and it was super packed. We put our names on the waitlist and waited approximately 15-20 minutes for seats. It\\'s VERY dark inside, which is okay, but I generally don\\'t tend to like that ambiance. On the ceilings there were scary pointy \"sol\" lights that looked slightly precarious, but were beautiful. The entrance has a bar, where people waiting can get drinks or just sit at bar. The drinks looked really good! If I return, I would definitely want to try a drink here.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, we took a look at the menu, and boy, is it pricey! ~$15 AT LEAST per plate. For the amount and quality, it definitely was not worth it for me. Maybe it was the dishes we ordered. We got the chips and with 3x of salsas of varying flavors and spiciness. My favorite is the green one. We got the guacamole, which I thought was only okay. It was kind of bland with no flavor or kick. The avocados tasted fresh though. I\\'ve had much better before. I got the Grandma\\'s Old 19th century chicken, which I didn\\'t particularly enjoy. The chicken was VERY tender and amazing consistency, but the sauce was this odd sweet/savory combination. It came with a side of rice and beans. My friends got the sea bass tacos, which also came with side of rice and beans. The sea bass tacos were really good, they were grilled, had vegetables, and soft flavorful meat.\\n\\nThe food quality was just okay, nothing special for the prices.', u\"This place wasn't bad for Mexican food in the South Bay. For really good Mexican, I'd still head into the city. I thought their margaritas were really good, as were the salsas. The sauce on my shrimp enchiladas were just aight, nothing special.\", u\"Came here tonight with the family for the first time. The 4 of us ordered our mains and an a la carte order of Beans and Rice......Stupid us, the a la carte option was not on the menu but we assumed it would be reasonably priced.\\n\\nThe a la carte order of beans and rice was $17 alone...WTF. I never expected a side of beans  and rice would in very small bowls would cost me MORE THAN MY MAIN COURSE WITH THE SAME small VOLUMN OF RICE AND BEANS.\\n\\nNot cool. For reference, my 2 enchilada meal with rice and beans was $15. The a la carte order of rice and beans was $17 on the bill and came with the same amount of rice and beans as my enchilada meal...minus the enchilada...\\n\\nI'm not very smart, but this reeks of stupid.\\n\\nI take responsibility for not asking about the price. I also hold them responsible for not being transparent about their pricing.\", u\"Great decor, amazing food.\\n\\nJust got home from my first trip to Vive Sol, fianc\\xe9 in tow, and I'm glad we finally checked it out. Interior has lots of yellow light coming from some beautiful punched metal starburst shaped lanterns. Angels adorn the walls, they gaze off into the distance or at some pottery.\\n\\nChips and three types of salsa are placed on your table shortly after you arrive. All quite acidic and at least one of them was spicy. The chips need to be salted.\\n\\nWe ordered and shared the milanesa and the pollo negro. The milanesa was very savory and oily, it was greatly improved by adding a little of the sauce from the pollo negro. The chicken was excellent, the accompanying sauce was tangy and you could really taste the garlic. It came served on top of a bed of spinach and goat cheese crumbles. Beans and rice came with both. We also were offered a small stack of tortillas with our meal and they were delicious, the perfect amount of chewy.\", u\"Every time I go to this place, I love my meal. It's a must-visit whenever I'm in the area.\\n\\nI still order the same thing every time: enchiladas. One with mole, one with guajillo sauce. So delicious. And why are the black beans so wonderful? Something sinful and awesome like bacon fat?? I don't know, but yum.\\n\\nDefinitely a gem. Don't go in a rush... It's not a rushed place.\", u\"The waiting time for dinner on weeknights can be really long, which surprises me. But I guess it shouldn't, since the food here is really good, the restaurant building is adorable, and the prices for Silicon Valley are really reasonable.\\n\\nFree fresh, thin, crispy tortilla chips and salsa. So addictive!\\n\\nThe chocolate cake dessert and the flan are very good.\\n\\nI definitely recommend their mole - very tasty and flavorful.\\n\\nParking when they are busy can be kind of difficult.  The lot definitely is not big enough.\\n\\nI like that they provide you with carafes of water rather than constantly having to get refills.\\n\\nI have been here a few times and will definitely continue going, though probably more for lunch because dinner is so busy all the time.\", u\"Really quality food and drinks. Came here for lunch not expecting it to be this nice but it was a good change. I got the fish tacos (after seeing a yelp pic) and they were really tasty. It tasted fresh vs. other fish tacos. The presentation of the dish was really nice and after seeing my friends dish I want to come back for more... however after a good meal and couple drinks I probably can't afford to come back as often as I would like (pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants).\", u\"Came here again last week for dinner. It's still great! I love the food and ambiance. It would be a great place to take a date.\\n\\nHad the enchiladas Al sol again and a margarita which does not play around ;) Really delicious from start to finish. Great reward after a hard work day. Enjoy this place!\", u'This place is such a hidden gem! I\\'ve lived near mountain view a long time and never been here until now, thanks to yelp. It is hard to find because it\\'s behind another building, but look out for it once you past the Camino Inn.\\n\\nThe decor is very nice, with pretty star lights and a \"pueblo-like\" feel. The place was packed when we went, which is always a good sign of a tasty restaurant. Unfortunately they don\\'t take reservations so it\\'s good to call a head to get a wait time estimate.\\n\\nThe food was delicious and good sized portions. Everything was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.\\n\\nThe caldo de pollo (chicken soup) was great, though a bit on the salty side. There was a lot of chicken and the chicken was nice and tender. We ordered a large and shared between 4 people.\\n\\nI ordered the tomatillo which was good, but nothing amazing. The roasted tomatillo sauce was the best part of this dish. I highly recommend the lomo de puerco, which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful!\\n\\nWe also got a complimentary chocolate cake for a birthday, which was amazing! I don\\'t even like chocolate but I kept wanting more of this. It\\'s not too sweet, but still very moist.', u\"My coworkers really enjoy eating here. I myself, am not a huge fan. The portions here are large when it comes to enchiladas and burritos, otherwise... it's the norm. Their shrimp diabla was not sauced. It does have a good smoky flavor to it, but definitely not the normal sauced up shrimp in spicy sauce. You get 7 good sized shrimps grilled with onions and tomatoes, served with beans and rice.\\n\\nIf you ever want to order guacamole here, don't. You won't get it, and if you do, it's' because you've pestered the waiter to get it before you really eat your meal. Otherwise, expect them to put it on your bill without serving it to you.\\n\\nThe salsa here is never consistent. Sometimes they're spicy, sometimes they are just bland and watery. Not enjoyable when you don't know what to expect. But do expect them to remove this from your table before your bill comes. I don't understand that concept.\\n\\nThere are tons of employees/waiters here. To waive one down, takes a bit of time. Be patient, and make sure you have enough time to wait for service.\\n\\nTo each their own right? This place, is not the place I'd miss once I've left.\", u\"You can not see the name of the restaurant easily from the outside while driving so that makes it hard to find. It is too loud inside and they don't have selection of beans and rice. If you like black beans that might work for you. However service is excellent and portions are very generous. They put a lot of meat in burritos. I also like the lights, not too bright.\", u\"Best enchiladas I have ever had! I have tried all the enchiladas on the menu, and all are unbelievably flavorful. My favorites are the chipotle and guajillo - so well done! And the filling is generous with lots of tender meat.\\n\\nNot only that, the margaritas here are also amazing. (Coworkers have mentioned enjoying the tequila selection, but I personally haven't tried many here.)\\n\\nDecor is also fantastic, as well as the cute patio. It's always lively and fun with great service!\", u'Vive Sol has now become part of my regular rotation, as the food and experience is so superior compared with the generally underwhelming food scene of MV. Vive Sol is unassuming from the front, but when you drive into the back courtyard you are in an oasis of a parking lot, full of flora, foliage and delicious smelling honeysuckles. Both the decor and atmosphere are bright, energetic and loud and the food is simple yet delicious and a fantastic bang for your buck.\\nThe pescado a la mulata is a standout and make sure to try two different sauces when you order the enchiladas (mole and al guajillo are my favorites).', u'Very tasty food with great ambiance.  Patio seating was fantastic except there was no music.', u\"Had good dinner here. We tried some margaritas and sangria, both were good.\\nI ordered tacos, which weren't really on menu, but ordered one each with chicken, pork and beef. Chicken and beef were great, pork was okay. The salsa with the chips was really, really good.\", u\"Drinks are very good and the food is great, too.\\n\\nThe service was really nice and I like how it has both indoor and outdoor seating. We came here early on a Friday night and it wasn't super packet, yet.\\n\\nI really liked my margarita and they give a lot in the glass. :)  My only issue was that I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and it came with no sauce; it was covered with beans.  I like having beans with my enchiladas but it was rather dry. I got some of the tomatillo salsa on the side but it wasn't the same experience.  I would definitely come here again, but I will probably order something else next time.\", u\"Wow this place is good.\\n\\nWe went on a Sunday night and didn't need to wait. I'm assuming Fri and Sat nights are a lot busier.\\n\\n- Red Sangria is a must try.\\n- The chalupas were not what we were expecting, but they were great\\n- enchiladas del sol were great.\\n\\nOverall one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in the area.\", u\"After looking over Yelp for a new place to try in Mountain View, I ended up at this restaurant and it was a great experience.\\n\\nYou really have to keep an eye out for it on El Camino, and there is just a small parking lot in the very back, so I highly recommend non-peak hours if you don't like hassling with waiting for a parking spot.\\n\\nThey have two dining areas, a covered all outdoor dining area to one side that is really lovely and a regular indoor restaurant.  We ate inside this time. The decor is really fantastic and creates a great ambiance.  They have nice big windows and they had them open during the summer when we went, which created a great breeze.  The have an entrance through the restaurant in the back from the parking lot and off El Camino too.  There is also a full bar.\\n\\nThe support staff service was great.  We got a bottle of water on our table, a basket of chips and 3 different kinds of salsa asap with the menus.  The support staff would consistently swing by and offer refills of water from the bottle, extra salsa of the one we preferred more than others, and more and more chips.  \\n\\nThe server was ok, kind of aloof and actually pretty slow to respond.  It took awhile to get our order taken, and also for the bill to arrive.  We had to flag down our server via the support staff actually, to make it happen.   Without the support staff helping so much, I really am not sure that I would have enjoyed the experience so much with the quality of the service from just the server.\\n\\nThe food was awesome!!  The rice is vegetarian, which is great.  A lot of mexican restaurants actually use chicken broth, but I inquired and this place does not.  \\n\\nI ordered some cheese enchiladas mexicanas and the sauce and everything was really delicious. It was just enough food too, not too much or too little.  My husband ordered the seafood soup with corn dumplings in it and he loved it.  The only thing is they don't remove the shrimp tails so you have to handle them when they are quite hot from the soup's heat - which isn't super fun and take them off.\\n\\nOverall, it was great.  The prices were very good too.  I will definitely be back and its going on my list of top places when I want mexican food in Mountain View.\\n\\nSo happy to find another great place, and thanks to all the Yelp reviewers too for pointing me in the direction of this place !\", u'After being a favorite of mine for years...it pains me to say they have gone down hill recently.\\n\\nCons\\nGuacamole was tasteless...either they are using cheaper ingredients or some kind of fillers. Chips were stale like they were left out from the night before. The margaritas tasted like they are now using a cheap mix and unfortunately had very little alcohol.\\nThe entree I ordered had a hair on the side of the plate (by now I could have used the alcohol from a decent margarita )\\nWay overpriced for the food quality\\nWait was a good 30 minutes and, just not worth it.\\n\\nPros\\nThe decor is delightful\\nParking is easy\\n\\nNot sure if it is new management or current management is getting greedy and going with cheap ingredients and getting sloppy with cleanliness practices!\\n\\nAt this point, I would recommend passing up this place just driving down the street and going to Estrellitas...', u'Went here to get dinner and margaritas with some girlfriends. The service was a bit slow and it was pretty busy and packed for a Wednesday night. The \"La Dona\" margarita was delicious. We then got the X-rated which we didn\\'t like cause it was too fruity and we weren\\'t able to finish it.\\n\\nThey did get my order wrong, but it wasn\\'t too big of a deal (I didnt want beans but gave them to be instead of double rice). We both got the enchiladas verdes which were good.\\n\\nI would definitely come back for food and drinks :)\\nGreat little place and cute outdoor area as well. Their parking lot is pretty small so we had to street park across the street which wasn\\'t too big of a deal.', u\"Great chips and good food, but I agree with others that the waiter taking orders makes mistakes and doesn't seem to want to fix it.  By now, he should REPEAT the orders to make sure he heard it correctly.  He got our drink order and one of our food entree order wrong.  \\n\\nThere was a medium length hair in one of the salsa dishes.  \\n\\nThey have 1 woman's toilet and 1 for the men.  Seriously, install an extra toilet and better ventilation for the women!!  This place makes enough to afford it.  I've waited 10 minutes to use the bathroom before.\", u'I really find this place to be touch-and-go when it comes to food quality. I\\'ve been here about 8 times now, and I\\'m not sure if I\\'ll go again. Our orders are frequently messed up, and the food quality is not good enough to warrant giving Vive Sol another try. When it\\'s good, it\\'s really, really good. But, unfortunately this is too rare.\\n\\nOn our last visit, we began by ordering the Coctelde Camaron and the Ceviche as appetizers. Both were warm (not chilled), and bland. Both were very disappointing and remained unfinished. Side note: I recently purchases some cerviche from Costco, which was significantly better than the one from Vive Sol. Now, that\\'s just not right! Costco sets a pretty good standard, however any restaurant should surpass the Costco standard, because restaurants specialize in \"food\" and \"meals\". Anyway, after the disappointing appetizers, our main course orders were messed up again!\\n\\nIf Vive Sol was consistent with it\\'s high quality, I\\'d give it 5 stars. But, it\\'s just too inconsistent.\\n\\nIn summary: Food = average: Staff = average.', u\"Anyone remotely near the Bay Area needs to visit Vive Sol -- hands down the best chile rellenos I have ever eaten in my entire life!\\n\\nI used to make chile rellenos from scratch -- a culinary endeavor that requires a good amount of patience and time -- and these taste even better than homemade!\\n\\nThey are as fluffy as a cloud and so incredibly tender that every time I eat them I want to eat them for every meal the rest of my life.\\n\\nI have even had foodie dreams about eating at this restaurant. That's how good it is!\\n\\nThe margaritas are on deck and the salsa trio with chips is excellent as well\\n\\nKeep up the good work!! Please open a location in Orange County!!!\", u\"I have lived in the Bay Area most of my life, save a few years living away from home.\\nWIth Vive Sol right on the El Camino, I have driven past the little place for years. Set back from the El Camino a bit, and with the front pretty tiny and unassuming, Vive Sol is a hidden gem! My partner and I looooove Mexican food. And we love eating out at fun places. While doing a Yelp search for margaritas, my favirite drink, Vive Sol jumped on my radar. Out of nowhere.\\nVive Sol. Really? It always looked like this dinky tiny little place. But it has been here for a while. With rent prices skyrocketing, it has to be good to last.\\nLooked at the menu. A little on the pricey side, but when we have a few extra bucks in our pocket, we have no problem splurging on a place with good reviews on their food and drinks.\\nDecor is a little odd. Mismatched. But you aren't here for that.\\nIt's all about the food.\\nHad the combo enchiladas and margaritas. Sauces on the enchiladas were amazing. Margaritas were top notch.\\nCan't see us coming back here too often, because of the prices, but when it's time for a special occasion, Vive Sol is on the list!\", u'Slow service, different prices on different food and drink menus, and mysterious liquor upcharges on the bill. I feel cheated.\\n\\nLet me give you the couple of upsides to this place before going into all that is wrong with it.\\n-Nice hostesses, friendly (but slow and mostly absent waiter) and nice decor. The rest was pretty poor.\\n\\n4 of us went there for dinner. We were seated, the busboy brought chips and salsa and a bottle of water-- he didn\\'t pour it into our glasses--just sat the bottle on the table, he didn\\'t acknowledge us or smile, he just dropped stuff off and walked away.\\n\\nSo we read the menus and waited for a waiter. The first thing we noticed was the all of the items on my wife\\'s menu were $1 less than the rest of out menus. OK I guess they neglected to get rid of the old menus, not a biggie. (But wait, it\\'s a pattern here!)\\n\\nSo we continued to sit and wait for a waiter...5 minutes go by, 10 minutes go by, 15 minutes go by and no one has even looked in our direction or acknowledged us, no one even close enough or paying enough attention for us to flag them down.\\n\\nI saw a lady leaning against a wall and waved her over. I asked if anyone was going to wait on us. She didn\\'t seem to know so I asked her to find out and to please get us a pitcher of margaritas while we wait. She mumbled something which I couldn\\'t understand and walked away and never came back so I didn\\'t know if the margaritas were on the way or not.\\n\\nAnd so we continued to wait...now it\\'s 20 minutes with no waiter and no drinks, the bottle of water has long been empty and nobody comes to give us more water.\\n\\nFINALLY, 25 MINUTES AFTER WE SAT DOWN, a cheery waiter comes up and asks how we\\'re doing. I said half joking but firmly, \"we\\'ve been waiting 25 minutes and still haven\\'t placed an order nor gotten anything to drink.\" Just then a pitcher of margaritas arrived. FINALLY!!!!\\n\\nTo save time I won\\'t write down ALL of the stuff that went wrong, but let me just say this about the continuing service...he was always friendly and we were always friendly to him but it always seemed like he was in a rush to get somewhere else. Once the margaritas arrived he walked away before we could order. Then he came back later and we finally got to order an appetizer and tried to give him our main course orders but he walked away again. Finally, literally 35 minutes after sitting down we got to give him our order.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nMeh. Really underwhelming. No flavor. Costs 30%-40% than any of 100 other Mexican restaurants in the area that have better food.\\n\\nTHE BILL:\\nFinally we\\'re finished and get the bill. Hmmm...$40 for a pitcher of margaritas. We had two so it was $80 for two pitchers of margaritas. Odd because the only pitcher of margaritas on the drink menu *that I received* said they were $30 each. (Which is already several dollars over-priced compared to comparable restaurants.) So I go to the hostess stand and grab another drink menu and the price on it says $33, not $30 like my menu said--more pricing inconsistency just like the food menus.\\n\\nWe asked the guy handling the bill why we got charged $40 when the menu said $30 and/or $33. He asked \"what did you say when you ordered?\" And I said \"please bring me a pitcher of margaritas\" (because there was only one pitcher on my menu.) And he says \"no, if you order a pitcher of margaritas then we give you this one\"...pointing on the menu to a GLASS of top shelf margaritas, which does not have a pitcher price. So wait, we order the only pitcher of margaritas on the menu and you decide that it\\'s OK to charge us $10 more than it says on the menu? Not cool.\\n\\nSo to sum it all up...slooooooowwwwwww service...we get different menus with different food prices on them, we never get water refilled, food is bland and way over-priced, we are given a drink menu, we order from that menu and we get charged $10 more than is on the menu for each pitcher for some mysterious hidden premium pitcher of margaritas.\\n\\nBasically I feel like they bent me over and stuck it to me. Never again. Stay away!!!', u\"Came here for my first time the other day.\\n\\nWe were greeted nicely at the door and seated promptly. Our server was courteous and always made we had water and fresh chips and salsa at the table!\\n\\nMy friend and I had their house margarita and habanero margarita. Both were delicious with a decent amount of tequila inside.\\n\\nI had their enchilada with mol\\xe9 sauce, and I was so pleased with how it turned out. Their mol\\xe9 is rich, creamy and delicious!\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place to a friend and plan on going back soon!\\n\\nOnly bad part we didn't enjoy was the jerk that decided to block us in our parking spot. Not sure why employees didn't seem to mind the random parking in the middle of the lot with no spots that ended up blocking customers in, but they let it happen. My friend had to complete a 87 point turn through bushes to get out. That was annoying, but besides that, we had a good experience.\", u\"We came here for work lunch, and the food is amazing. I got the guajilla chicken (not the enchilada), and it was really good! The service was good too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that Yelp says they don't take reservations, and we were a big group so I got there early to get a table. They asked if I have a reservation.. Whatttt, I should've called and confirmed but I just believed what it said on Yelp so I didn't. Not a problem though, we were  seated with a short wait in the patio, so that was good!\", u\"I would have never found this place if my colleague had not mentioned it. It's on El Camino but its tucked inside a bit. They have a decent sized parking lot. The restaurant has a nice and clean ambiance.\\n\\nFood and service is pretty good too. It does get pretty crowded during peak hour so get in early or reserve a table ahead.\", u\"We were looking for a sit down Mexican restaurant and Vive Sol fit the bill. On a Saturday night it seemed really crowded - we were lucky to wait & get 1 parking space that opened, and it looked packed inside - but we were pleasantly surprised to be told there would only be a 10 minute wait for a table, which turned out to be only five minutes or so.\\n\\nOverall I was happy with the food. The menu was slightly limited in some ways - most of it was burritos and enchiladas, and I couldn't tell the differences among all of the options, which weren't fully described. However, the soups also looked interesting and some of the specials were a bit more unique. The enchiladas were quite good, and I liked the rice and beans as well. The chile colorado (called Sonora here) was excellent. The chips & salsa were more mediocre, and the latter is given out in piddling amounts. But we'd definitely come back for the main courses!\", u\"I've dined in a couple of times, love the ambiance. Mostly I get their chicken soups when I am hungover and they are fantastic :P\", u\"Cute place, great ambiance. In the evening, the sunlight shines in warmly through the windows. I love it.\\n\\nI got one of the server's recommendations - two enchiladas: one chicken with red sauce and one pork with green sauce. Both were tasty, but next time I'd get two chicken enchiladas. The chicken meat was very tender and juicy. The sauces were delicious. The rice and beans were so good that it was hard to stop eating them even when I was full.  I also filled up on their delicious chips and salsa.\\n\\nThis is one of my favorite Mexican places in Mountain View!\", u'OMG. Deliciousness. I am a bean and rice fanatic... and by fanatic, I mean every meal could be Mexican food and I would be happy. I have tried some of what would be called \"the best Mexican restaurants in the Bay Area\" and this by far is my favorite.\\n\\nThe margartias are made to perfection. None of that cheap margarita mix crap, these are made with all the right, fresh ingredients... My favorite thing is definitely the Grandma\\'s sauce... It\\'s like heaven in your mouth. Mini orgasms with every bite.\\n\\nAnd HOLY GUACAMOLE. Literally. It\\'s holy its ssooooo freaking good.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and eat here. Eat here every day. Crap, I want to eat there now... Maybe I will have to stop this review so I can go eat there... yumm. food.', u\"I absolutely dislike Vive Sol in Palo Alto, so I was wary of checking this one out, but I'm so glad I did! I've been so many times since then, and I always enjoy it. Their chips and salsa are yummy, but their chips aren't as fresh and crispy as other places.\\n\\nI have tried various combinations for dinner, but my favorite is the cheese and onion enchilada with red sauce/ veggie tostada. I also like the enfrijoladas- the grilled veggie enchiladas topped with a black bean sauce. So unique and delicious, but I hesitate to order that more often because it doesn't come with rice :(\\n\\nMinus one star because of their ridiculously petty pricing- I came with my family and my dad asked if they could make his dish spicy. The waiter said sure, he could give us some green chillies with the dish. When the bill came, they had charged something crazy like $4 for a tiny bowl of chopped chillies... I could head over to India Cash & Carry and BUY $4 of chillies that would last me over a month.\\n\\nWould I come back? Yup, I always do :)\", u\"Nice outdoor seating and has wood carved mirrors, metal lanterns and that type of decor which makes for a cozy atmosphere. I went against my usual rule of sticking with beer when I don't know the margarita situation and was sorely disappointed. $33 pitcher that probably consisted of an entire bottle of sweet&sour and four shots of tequila which barely put a dent in the mix. Sickly sweet. Had to ask for a bunch of lime wedges just to try to add some acidity still barely finished half. Big waste of money. The food is OK but overpriced. $15.50 for two enchiladas, beans and rice and when I asked for sour cream I was told I'd be charged another $1.50 . Go for the atmosphere and beer. Then go get food at the taco truck down the street which smelled amazing.\", u'Had a great meal in this Mountain View restaurant!\\n\\nThe food was unexpected, really savory but not hot allowing you to really enjoy the meld of the flavors.  There are good and non-traditional choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians.\\n\\nWhen the weather is good they have a lovely outside area where you can sit and enjoy live music. They will also change things up for you if ask...we had one person with a double order of beans (instead of beans and rice) and one with a double rice, both at no extra charge.', u\"First, the decor of this place is awesome! beautiful bar in the front and a dinning room lit with candles and a mix of very nice mix of the restaurant in the back and the bar in the front for the waiting area.\\n\\nSecond, parking is a bit challenging here. There are about 10 total spots for cars and then street parking right of El Camino. I'd advise getting something on the street because it is just a pain to do anything back in their parking area.\\n\\nThird, their chips and salsa combination is amazing! one of my favorite in the bay area. Chips are flakey by strong and the salsa's are mixed with medium to medium/hot. Their Guac is really really good! One of my favorite overall and for less than $9 it's not a bad deal overall.\\n\\nI usually order anything with grandma's old recipe sauce also know as Al Guajillo it's a mix of creamy with more of a chipotle spicy type of sauce. I usually get it with Enchiladas chicken, but I have also had it vegetarian style and it is kick ass as well! My wife prefers the Mole sauce which is more of a spicy earthy like sauce for her enchiladas.\\n\\nIf you are big into drinking their margs are a powerful kick in the face! I prefer starting with one of those and shifting to a beer because not only do they taste great, they will get you going pretty quickly. Two of the margs and I'd advise grabbing an Uber for the ride home.\", u'On the plus side: superior service, very good food, and the wine was great.\\nOn the negative side: bathrooms are outside of the restaurant and it was quite loud. At times I really had to raise my voice to be heard at my table.', u\"Vive Sol is an adorable restaurant set off El Camino and if you don't know it's there you'd never notice it by just driving by.  My sister recommended it as a cute, authentic Mexican restaurant and that's exactly what it is!\\n\\nThey brought out 3 different types of salsa with the chips ranging from mild, medium, to spicy.  They were each delicious in their own unique ways.\\n\\nI brought my children, ages 8 and 12 here.  They were the only children in the restaurant and while this is more of an adult-only setting, older, mature children can do well.  Just don't expect a children's menu.  One child ordered a quesadilla and the other nachos.  Both were delicious.  I ordered the Tampequina.  I wanted to order something different from what I usually get and I'm glad I did.  The sauce on the steak was somewhat sweet and not what I was expecting.  We had to request the nachos and Tampequina to be boxed up and taken home it was so much food.  And they are incredibly generous with the guacamole!  I don't think I've ever seen so much guacamole served for 2 people before!\\n\\nThe server was incredibly nice and attentive.\\n\\nWe sat inside, but the outside was really neat.  At least I *THINK* the outside is...it wasn't attached to the restaurant, rather on the other side of the alley way that leads to the parking lot.  Also, the restrooms were outside, which was a bit unusual.\\n\\nThe only downside I saw was that despite a decent sized parking lot, it was PACKED.  I was lucky to pull up just as a car was pulling out and snagged the only available space.\\n\\n5 stars and I will definitely be returning.\", u'Always a pleasure coming here. My favorite mexican place in the world.... Seriously. Primavera the host is super nice along side a girl I did not know.\\n\\nThe servers are excellent. ( I could be biased because 3 of my cousins work there)\\nValentine the bartender is my favorite!\\nI always get the enchiladas sol. Red sauce is absolutely the BEST but I also love the nueva sauce ( creamy chipotle sauce) and the guajillo sauce ( cream sauce).\\n\\nMargaritas are out of this world and the pollo negro ( chicken breast in a creamy white wine sauce that lays on a bed of spinach sprinkled with goat cheese) is unlike anything you will ever taste.\\n\\nEverything on the menu is Stellar. If you ever in the red wood city area opt for quinto sol one of the sister restaurants.', u'Hands down in my top two favorite Mexican restaurants of the bay area.  I always get the Enchiladas Al Sol and am never disappointed.  The mole is super rich with a great chocolate flavor, so for those who like their mole to be a little less rich, probably not the best option for you.  However, when you mix the mole with the red sauce from the other enchilada, you go to flavor heaven! The habanero margarita is super delicious and they give you three salsas to start which is always great.  Recommend for sure!', u'The parking here is super difficult, especially if you come during dinner crowds. Their parking lot is NOT big enough for their crowds. Good news is you can probably find street parking on the same block, but it can be a long walk/search.\\n\\nMy friends and I came on a Friday evening, and it was super packed. We put our names on the waitlist and waited approximately 15-20 minutes for seats. It\\'s VERY dark inside, which is okay, but I generally don\\'t tend to like that ambiance. On the ceilings there were scary pointy \"sol\" lights that looked slightly precarious, but were beautiful. The entrance has a bar, where people waiting can get drinks or just sit at bar. The drinks looked really good! If I return, I would definitely want to try a drink here.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, we took a look at the menu, and boy, is it pricey! ~$15 AT LEAST per plate. For the amount and quality, it definitely was not worth it for me. Maybe it was the dishes we ordered. We got the chips and with 3x of salsas of varying flavors and spiciness. My favorite is the green one. We got the guacamole, which I thought was only okay. It was kind of bland with no flavor or kick. The avocados tasted fresh though. I\\'ve had much better before. I got the Grandma\\'s Old 19th century chicken, which I didn\\'t particularly enjoy. The chicken was VERY tender and amazing consistency, but the sauce was this odd sweet/savory combination. It came with a side of rice and beans. My friends got the sea bass tacos, which also came with side of rice and beans. The sea bass tacos were really good, they were grilled, had vegetables, and soft flavorful meat.\\n\\nThe food quality was just okay, nothing special for the prices.', u\"This place wasn't bad for Mexican food in the South Bay. For really good Mexican, I'd still head into the city. I thought their margaritas were really good, as were the salsas. The sauce on my shrimp enchiladas were just aight, nothing special.\", u\"Came here tonight with the family for the first time. The 4 of us ordered our mains and an a la carte order of Beans and Rice......Stupid us, the a la carte option was not on the menu but we assumed it would be reasonably priced.\\n\\nThe a la carte order of beans and rice was $17 alone...WTF. I never expected a side of beans  and rice would in very small bowls would cost me MORE THAN MY MAIN COURSE WITH THE SAME small VOLUMN OF RICE AND BEANS.\\n\\nNot cool. For reference, my 2 enchilada meal with rice and beans was $15. The a la carte order of rice and beans was $17 on the bill and came with the same amount of rice and beans as my enchilada meal...minus the enchilada...\\n\\nI'm not very smart, but this reeks of stupid.\\n\\nI take responsibility for not asking about the price. I also hold them responsible for not being transparent about their pricing.\", u\"Great decor, amazing food.\\n\\nJust got home from my first trip to Vive Sol, fianc\\xe9 in tow, and I'm glad we finally checked it out. Interior has lots of yellow light coming from some beautiful punched metal starburst shaped lanterns. Angels adorn the walls, they gaze off into the distance or at some pottery.\\n\\nChips and three types of salsa are placed on your table shortly after you arrive. All quite acidic and at least one of them was spicy. The chips need to be salted.\\n\\nWe ordered and shared the milanesa and the pollo negro. The milanesa was very savory and oily, it was greatly improved by adding a little of the sauce from the pollo negro. The chicken was excellent, the accompanying sauce was tangy and you could really taste the garlic. It came served on top of a bed of spinach and goat cheese crumbles. Beans and rice came with both. We also were offered a small stack of tortillas with our meal and they were delicious, the perfect amount of chewy.\", u\"Every time I go to this place, I love my meal. It's a must-visit whenever I'm in the area.\\n\\nI still order the same thing every time: enchiladas. One with mole, one with guajillo sauce. So delicious. And why are the black beans so wonderful? Something sinful and awesome like bacon fat?? I don't know, but yum.\\n\\nDefinitely a gem. Don't go in a rush... It's not a rushed place.\", u\"The waiting time for dinner on weeknights can be really long, which surprises me. But I guess it shouldn't, since the food here is really good, the restaurant building is adorable, and the prices for Silicon Valley are really reasonable.\\n\\nFree fresh, thin, crispy tortilla chips and salsa. So addictive!\\n\\nThe chocolate cake dessert and the flan are very good.\\n\\nI definitely recommend their mole - very tasty and flavorful.\\n\\nParking when they are busy can be kind of difficult.  The lot definitely is not big enough.\\n\\nI like that they provide you with carafes of water rather than constantly having to get refills.\\n\\nI have been here a few times and will definitely continue going, though probably more for lunch because dinner is so busy all the time.\", u\"Really quality food and drinks. Came here for lunch not expecting it to be this nice but it was a good change. I got the fish tacos (after seeing a yelp pic) and they were really tasty. It tasted fresh vs. other fish tacos. The presentation of the dish was really nice and after seeing my friends dish I want to come back for more... however after a good meal and couple drinks I probably can't afford to come back as often as I would like (pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants).\", u\"Came here again last week for dinner. It's still great! I love the food and ambiance. It would be a great place to take a date.\\n\\nHad the enchiladas Al sol again and a margarita which does not play around ;) Really delicious from start to finish. Great reward after a hard work day. Enjoy this place!\", u'This place is such a hidden gem! I\\'ve lived near mountain view a long time and never been here until now, thanks to yelp. It is hard to find because it\\'s behind another building, but look out for it once you past the Camino Inn.\\n\\nThe decor is very nice, with pretty star lights and a \"pueblo-like\" feel. The place was packed when we went, which is always a good sign of a tasty restaurant. Unfortunately they don\\'t take reservations so it\\'s good to call a head to get a wait time estimate.\\n\\nThe food was delicious and good sized portions. Everything was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.\\n\\nThe caldo de pollo (chicken soup) was great, though a bit on the salty side. There was a lot of chicken and the chicken was nice and tender. We ordered a large and shared between 4 people.\\n\\nI ordered the tomatillo which was good, but nothing amazing. The roasted tomatillo sauce was the best part of this dish. I highly recommend the lomo de puerco, which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful!\\n\\nWe also got a complimentary chocolate cake for a birthday, which was amazing! I don\\'t even like chocolate but I kept wanting more of this. It\\'s not too sweet, but still very moist.', u\"My coworkers really enjoy eating here. I myself, am not a huge fan. The portions here are large when it comes to enchiladas and burritos, otherwise... it's the norm. Their shrimp diabla was not sauced. It does have a good smoky flavor to it, but definitely not the normal sauced up shrimp in spicy sauce. You get 7 good sized shrimps grilled with onions and tomatoes, served with beans and rice.\\n\\nIf you ever want to order guacamole here, don't. You won't get it, and if you do, it's' because you've pestered the waiter to get it before you really eat your meal. Otherwise, expect them to put it on your bill without serving it to you.\\n\\nThe salsa here is never consistent. Sometimes they're spicy, sometimes they are just bland and watery. Not enjoyable when you don't know what to expect. But do expect them to remove this from your table before your bill comes. I don't understand that concept.\\n\\nThere are tons of employees/waiters here. To waive one down, takes a bit of time. Be patient, and make sure you have enough time to wait for service.\\n\\nTo each their own right? This place, is not the place I'd miss once I've left.\", u\"You can not see the name of the restaurant easily from the outside while driving so that makes it hard to find. It is too loud inside and they don't have selection of beans and rice. If you like black beans that might work for you. However service is excellent and portions are very generous. They put a lot of meat in burritos. I also like the lights, not too bright.\", u\"Best enchiladas I have ever had! I have tried all the enchiladas on the menu, and all are unbelievably flavorful. My favorites are the chipotle and guajillo - so well done! And the filling is generous with lots of tender meat.\\n\\nNot only that, the margaritas here are also amazing. (Coworkers have mentioned enjoying the tequila selection, but I personally haven't tried many here.)\\n\\nDecor is also fantastic, as well as the cute patio. It's always lively and fun with great service!\", u'Vive Sol has now become part of my regular rotation, as the food and experience is so superior compared with the generally underwhelming food scene of MV. Vive Sol is unassuming from the front, but when you drive into the back courtyard you are in an oasis of a parking lot, full of flora, foliage and delicious smelling honeysuckles. Both the decor and atmosphere are bright, energetic and loud and the food is simple yet delicious and a fantastic bang for your buck.\\nThe pescado a la mulata is a standout and make sure to try two different sauces when you order the enchiladas (mole and al guajillo are my favorites).', u'Very tasty food with great ambiance.  Patio seating was fantastic except there was no music.', u\"Had good dinner here. We tried some margaritas and sangria, both were good.\\nI ordered tacos, which weren't really on menu, but ordered one each with chicken, pork and beef. Chicken and beef were great, pork was okay. The salsa with the chips was really, really good.\", u\"Drinks are very good and the food is great, too.\\n\\nThe service was really nice and I like how it has both indoor and outdoor seating. We came here early on a Friday night and it wasn't super packet, yet.\\n\\nI really liked my margarita and they give a lot in the glass. :)  My only issue was that I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and it came with no sauce; it was covered with beans.  I like having beans with my enchiladas but it was rather dry. I got some of the tomatillo salsa on the side but it wasn't the same experience.  I would definitely come here again, but I will probably order something else next time.\", u\"Wow this place is good.\\n\\nWe went on a Sunday night and didn't need to wait. I'm assuming Fri and Sat nights are a lot busier.\\n\\n- Red Sangria is a must try.\\n- The chalupas were not what we were expecting, but they were great\\n- enchiladas del sol were great.\\n\\nOverall one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in the area.\", u\"After looking over Yelp for a new place to try in Mountain View, I ended up at this restaurant and it was a great experience.\\n\\nYou really have to keep an eye out for it on El Camino, and there is just a small parking lot in the very back, so I highly recommend non-peak hours if you don't like hassling with waiting for a parking spot.\\n\\nThey have two dining areas, a covered all outdoor dining area to one side that is really lovely and a regular indoor restaurant.  We ate inside this time. The decor is really fantastic and creates a great ambiance.  They have nice big windows and they had them open during the summer when we went, which created a great breeze.  The have an entrance through the restaurant in the back from the parking lot and off El Camino too.  There is also a full bar.\\n\\nThe support staff service was great.  We got a bottle of water on our table, a basket of chips and 3 different kinds of salsa asap with the menus.  The support staff would consistently swing by and offer refills of water from the bottle, extra salsa of the one we preferred more than others, and more and more chips.  \\n\\nThe server was ok, kind of aloof and actually pretty slow to respond.  It took awhile to get our order taken, and also for the bill to arrive.  We had to flag down our server via the support staff actually, to make it happen.   Without the support staff helping so much, I really am not sure that I would have enjoyed the experience so much with the quality of the service from just the server.\\n\\nThe food was awesome!!  The rice is vegetarian, which is great.  A lot of mexican restaurants actually use chicken broth, but I inquired and this place does not.  \\n\\nI ordered some cheese enchiladas mexicanas and the sauce and everything was really delicious. It was just enough food too, not too much or too little.  My husband ordered the seafood soup with corn dumplings in it and he loved it.  The only thing is they don't remove the shrimp tails so you have to handle them when they are quite hot from the soup's heat - which isn't super fun and take them off.\\n\\nOverall, it was great.  The prices were very good too.  I will definitely be back and its going on my list of top places when I want mexican food in Mountain View.\\n\\nSo happy to find another great place, and thanks to all the Yelp reviewers too for pointing me in the direction of this place !\", u'After being a favorite of mine for years...it pains me to say they have gone down hill recently.\\n\\nCons\\nGuacamole was tasteless...either they are using cheaper ingredients or some kind of fillers. Chips were stale like they were left out from the night before. The margaritas tasted like they are now using a cheap mix and unfortunately had very little alcohol.\\nThe entree I ordered had a hair on the side of the plate (by now I could have used the alcohol from a decent margarita )\\nWay overpriced for the food quality\\nWait was a good 30 minutes and, just not worth it.\\n\\nPros\\nThe decor is delightful\\nParking is easy\\n\\nNot sure if it is new management or current management is getting greedy and going with cheap ingredients and getting sloppy with cleanliness practices!\\n\\nAt this point, I would recommend passing up this place just driving down the street and going to Estrellitas...', u'Went here to get dinner and margaritas with some girlfriends. The service was a bit slow and it was pretty busy and packed for a Wednesday night. The \"La Dona\" margarita was delicious. We then got the X-rated which we didn\\'t like cause it was too fruity and we weren\\'t able to finish it.\\n\\nThey did get my order wrong, but it wasn\\'t too big of a deal (I didnt want beans but gave them to be instead of double rice). We both got the enchiladas verdes which were good.\\n\\nI would definitely come back for food and drinks :)\\nGreat little place and cute outdoor area as well. Their parking lot is pretty small so we had to street park across the street which wasn\\'t too big of a deal.', u\"Great chips and good food, but I agree with others that the waiter taking orders makes mistakes and doesn't seem to want to fix it.  By now, he should REPEAT the orders to make sure he heard it correctly.  He got our drink order and one of our food entree order wrong.  \\n\\nThere was a medium length hair in one of the salsa dishes.  \\n\\nThey have 1 woman's toilet and 1 for the men.  Seriously, install an extra toilet and better ventilation for the women!!  This place makes enough to afford it.  I've waited 10 minutes to use the bathroom before.\", u'I really find this place to be touch-and-go when it comes to food quality. I\\'ve been here about 8 times now, and I\\'m not sure if I\\'ll go again. Our orders are frequently messed up, and the food quality is not good enough to warrant giving Vive Sol another try. When it\\'s good, it\\'s really, really good. But, unfortunately this is too rare.\\n\\nOn our last visit, we began by ordering the Coctelde Camaron and the Ceviche as appetizers. Both were warm (not chilled), and bland. Both were very disappointing and remained unfinished. Side note: I recently purchases some cerviche from Costco, which was significantly better than the one from Vive Sol. Now, that\\'s just not right! Costco sets a pretty good standard, however any restaurant should surpass the Costco standard, because restaurants specialize in \"food\" and \"meals\". Anyway, after the disappointing appetizers, our main course orders were messed up again!\\n\\nIf Vive Sol was consistent with it\\'s high quality, I\\'d give it 5 stars. But, it\\'s just too inconsistent.\\n\\nIn summary: Food = average: Staff = average.', u\"Anyone remotely near the Bay Area needs to visit Vive Sol -- hands down the best chile rellenos I have ever eaten in my entire life!\\n\\nI used to make chile rellenos from scratch -- a culinary endeavor that requires a good amount of patience and time -- and these taste even better than homemade!\\n\\nThey are as fluffy as a cloud and so incredibly tender that every time I eat them I want to eat them for every meal the rest of my life.\\n\\nI have even had foodie dreams about eating at this restaurant. That's how good it is!\\n\\nThe margaritas are on deck and the salsa trio with chips is excellent as well\\n\\nKeep up the good work!! Please open a location in Orange County!!!\", u\"I have lived in the Bay Area most of my life, save a few years living away from home.\\nWIth Vive Sol right on the El Camino, I have driven past the little place for years. Set back from the El Camino a bit, and with the front pretty tiny and unassuming, Vive Sol is a hidden gem! My partner and I looooove Mexican food. And we love eating out at fun places. While doing a Yelp search for margaritas, my favirite drink, Vive Sol jumped on my radar. Out of nowhere.\\nVive Sol. Really? It always looked like this dinky tiny little place. But it has been here for a while. With rent prices skyrocketing, it has to be good to last.\\nLooked at the menu. A little on the pricey side, but when we have a few extra bucks in our pocket, we have no problem splurging on a place with good reviews on their food and drinks.\\nDecor is a little odd. Mismatched. But you aren't here for that.\\nIt's all about the food.\\nHad the combo enchiladas and margaritas. Sauces on the enchiladas were amazing. Margaritas were top notch.\\nCan't see us coming back here too often, because of the prices, but when it's time for a special occasion, Vive Sol is on the list!\", u'Slow service, different prices on different food and drink menus, and mysterious liquor upcharges on the bill. I feel cheated.\\n\\nLet me give you the couple of upsides to this place before going into all that is wrong with it.\\n-Nice hostesses, friendly (but slow and mostly absent waiter) and nice decor. The rest was pretty poor.\\n\\n4 of us went there for dinner. We were seated, the busboy brought chips and salsa and a bottle of water-- he didn\\'t pour it into our glasses--just sat the bottle on the table, he didn\\'t acknowledge us or smile, he just dropped stuff off and walked away.\\n\\nSo we read the menus and waited for a waiter. The first thing we noticed was the all of the items on my wife\\'s menu were $1 less than the rest of out menus. OK I guess they neglected to get rid of the old menus, not a biggie. (But wait, it\\'s a pattern here!)\\n\\nSo we continued to sit and wait for a waiter...5 minutes go by, 10 minutes go by, 15 minutes go by and no one has even looked in our direction or acknowledged us, no one even close enough or paying enough attention for us to flag them down.\\n\\nI saw a lady leaning against a wall and waved her over. I asked if anyone was going to wait on us. She didn\\'t seem to know so I asked her to find out and to please get us a pitcher of margaritas while we wait. She mumbled something which I couldn\\'t understand and walked away and never came back so I didn\\'t know if the margaritas were on the way or not.\\n\\nAnd so we continued to wait...now it\\'s 20 minutes with no waiter and no drinks, the bottle of water has long been empty and nobody comes to give us more water.\\n\\nFINALLY, 25 MINUTES AFTER WE SAT DOWN, a cheery waiter comes up and asks how we\\'re doing. I said half joking but firmly, \"we\\'ve been waiting 25 minutes and still haven\\'t placed an order nor gotten anything to drink.\" Just then a pitcher of margaritas arrived. FINALLY!!!!\\n\\nTo save time I won\\'t write down ALL of the stuff that went wrong, but let me just say this about the continuing service...he was always friendly and we were always friendly to him but it always seemed like he was in a rush to get somewhere else. Once the margaritas arrived he walked away before we could order. Then he came back later and we finally got to order an appetizer and tried to give him our main course orders but he walked away again. Finally, literally 35 minutes after sitting down we got to give him our order.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nMeh. Really underwhelming. No flavor. Costs 30%-40% than any of 100 other Mexican restaurants in the area that have better food.\\n\\nTHE BILL:\\nFinally we\\'re finished and get the bill. Hmmm...$40 for a pitcher of margaritas. We had two so it was $80 for two pitchers of margaritas. Odd because the only pitcher of margaritas on the drink menu *that I received* said they were $30 each. (Which is already several dollars over-priced compared to comparable restaurants.) So I go to the hostess stand and grab another drink menu and the price on it says $33, not $30 like my menu said--more pricing inconsistency just like the food menus.\\n\\nWe asked the guy handling the bill why we got charged $40 when the menu said $30 and/or $33. He asked \"what did you say when you ordered?\" And I said \"please bring me a pitcher of margaritas\" (because there was only one pitcher on my menu.) And he says \"no, if you order a pitcher of margaritas then we give you this one\"...pointing on the menu to a GLASS of top shelf margaritas, which does not have a pitcher price. So wait, we order the only pitcher of margaritas on the menu and you decide that it\\'s OK to charge us $10 more than it says on the menu? Not cool.\\n\\nSo to sum it all up...slooooooowwwwwww service...we get different menus with different food prices on them, we never get water refilled, food is bland and way over-priced, we are given a drink menu, we order from that menu and we get charged $10 more than is on the menu for each pitcher for some mysterious hidden premium pitcher of margaritas.\\n\\nBasically I feel like they bent me over and stuck it to me. Never again. Stay away!!!', u\"Came here for my first time the other day.\\n\\nWe were greeted nicely at the door and seated promptly. Our server was courteous and always made we had water and fresh chips and salsa at the table!\\n\\nMy friend and I had their house margarita and habanero margarita. Both were delicious with a decent amount of tequila inside.\\n\\nI had their enchilada with mol\\xe9 sauce, and I was so pleased with how it turned out. Their mol\\xe9 is rich, creamy and delicious!\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place to a friend and plan on going back soon!\\n\\nOnly bad part we didn't enjoy was the jerk that decided to block us in our parking spot. Not sure why employees didn't seem to mind the random parking in the middle of the lot with no spots that ended up blocking customers in, but they let it happen. My friend had to complete a 87 point turn through bushes to get out. That was annoying, but besides that, we had a good experience.\", u\"We came here for work lunch, and the food is amazing. I got the guajilla chicken (not the enchilada), and it was really good! The service was good too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that Yelp says they don't take reservations, and we were a big group so I got there early to get a table. They asked if I have a reservation.. Whatttt, I should've called and confirmed but I just believed what it said on Yelp so I didn't. Not a problem though, we were  seated with a short wait in the patio, so that was good!\", u\"I would have never found this place if my colleague had not mentioned it. It's on El Camino but its tucked inside a bit. They have a decent sized parking lot. The restaurant has a nice and clean ambiance.\\n\\nFood and service is pretty good too. It does get pretty crowded during peak hour so get in early or reserve a table ahead.\", u\"We were looking for a sit down Mexican restaurant and Vive Sol fit the bill. On a Saturday night it seemed really crowded - we were lucky to wait & get 1 parking space that opened, and it looked packed inside - but we were pleasantly surprised to be told there would only be a 10 minute wait for a table, which turned out to be only five minutes or so.\\n\\nOverall I was happy with the food. The menu was slightly limited in some ways - most of it was burritos and enchiladas, and I couldn't tell the differences among all of the options, which weren't fully described. However, the soups also looked interesting and some of the specials were a bit more unique. The enchiladas were quite good, and I liked the rice and beans as well. The chile colorado (called Sonora here) was excellent. The chips & salsa were more mediocre, and the latter is given out in piddling amounts. But we'd definitely come back for the main courses!\", u\"I've dined in a couple of times, love the ambiance. Mostly I get their chicken soups when I am hungover and they are fantastic :P\", u\"Cute place, great ambiance. In the evening, the sunlight shines in warmly through the windows. I love it.\\n\\nI got one of the server's recommendations - two enchiladas: one chicken with red sauce and one pork with green sauce. Both were tasty, but next time I'd get two chicken enchiladas. The chicken meat was very tender and juicy. The sauces were delicious. The rice and beans were so good that it was hard to stop eating them even when I was full.  I also filled up on their delicious chips and salsa.\\n\\nThis is one of my favorite Mexican places in Mountain View!\", u'OMG. Deliciousness. I am a bean and rice fanatic... and by fanatic, I mean every meal could be Mexican food and I would be happy. I have tried some of what would be called \"the best Mexican restaurants in the Bay Area\" and this by far is my favorite.\\n\\nThe margartias are made to perfection. None of that cheap margarita mix crap, these are made with all the right, fresh ingredients... My favorite thing is definitely the Grandma\\'s sauce... It\\'s like heaven in your mouth. Mini orgasms with every bite.\\n\\nAnd HOLY GUACAMOLE. Literally. It\\'s holy its ssooooo freaking good.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and eat here. Eat here every day. Crap, I want to eat there now... Maybe I will have to stop this review so I can go eat there... yumm. food.', u\"I absolutely dislike Vive Sol in Palo Alto, so I was wary of checking this one out, but I'm so glad I did! I've been so many times since then, and I always enjoy it. Their chips and salsa are yummy, but their chips aren't as fresh and crispy as other places.\\n\\nI have tried various combinations for dinner, but my favorite is the cheese and onion enchilada with red sauce/ veggie tostada. I also like the enfrijoladas- the grilled veggie enchiladas topped with a black bean sauce. So unique and delicious, but I hesitate to order that more often because it doesn't come with rice :(\\n\\nMinus one star because of their ridiculously petty pricing- I came with my family and my dad asked if they could make his dish spicy. The waiter said sure, he could give us some green chillies with the dish. When the bill came, they had charged something crazy like $4 for a tiny bowl of chopped chillies... I could head over to India Cash & Carry and BUY $4 of chillies that would last me over a month.\\n\\nWould I come back? Yup, I always do :)\", u\"Nice outdoor seating and has wood carved mirrors, metal lanterns and that type of decor which makes for a cozy atmosphere. I went against my usual rule of sticking with beer when I don't know the margarita situation and was sorely disappointed. $33 pitcher that probably consisted of an entire bottle of sweet&sour and four shots of tequila which barely put a dent in the mix. Sickly sweet. Had to ask for a bunch of lime wedges just to try to add some acidity still barely finished half. Big waste of money. The food is OK but overpriced. $15.50 for two enchiladas, beans and rice and when I asked for sour cream I was told I'd be charged another $1.50 . Go for the atmosphere and beer. Then go get food at the taco truck down the street which smelled amazing.\", u'Had a great meal in this Mountain View restaurant!\\n\\nThe food was unexpected, really savory but not hot allowing you to really enjoy the meld of the flavors.  There are good and non-traditional choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians.\\n\\nWhen the weather is good they have a lovely outside area where you can sit and enjoy live music. They will also change things up for you if ask...we had one person with a double order of beans (instead of beans and rice) and one with a double rice, both at no extra charge.', u\"First, the decor of this place is awesome! beautiful bar in the front and a dinning room lit with candles and a mix of very nice mix of the restaurant in the back and the bar in the front for the waiting area.\\n\\nSecond, parking is a bit challenging here. There are about 10 total spots for cars and then street parking right of El Camino. I'd advise getting something on the street because it is just a pain to do anything back in their parking area.\\n\\nThird, their chips and salsa combination is amazing! one of my favorite in the bay area. Chips are flakey by strong and the salsa's are mixed with medium to medium/hot. Their Guac is really really good! One of my favorite overall and for less than $9 it's not a bad deal overall.\\n\\nI usually order anything with grandma's old recipe sauce also know as Al Guajillo it's a mix of creamy with more of a chipotle spicy type of sauce. I usually get it with Enchiladas chicken, but I have also had it vegetarian style and it is kick ass as well! My wife prefers the Mole sauce which is more of a spicy earthy like sauce for her enchiladas.\\n\\nIf you are big into drinking their margs are a powerful kick in the face! I prefer starting with one of those and shifting to a beer because not only do they taste great, they will get you going pretty quickly. Two of the margs and I'd advise grabbing an Uber for the ride home.\", u'On the plus side: superior service, very good food, and the wine was great.\\nOn the negative side: bathrooms are outside of the restaurant and it was quite loud. At times I really had to raise my voice to be heard at my table.', u\"Vive Sol is an adorable restaurant set off El Camino and if you don't know it's there you'd never notice it by just driving by.  My sister recommended it as a cute, authentic Mexican restaurant and that's exactly what it is!\\n\\nThey brought out 3 different types of salsa with the chips ranging from mild, medium, to spicy.  They were each delicious in their own unique ways.\\n\\nI brought my children, ages 8 and 12 here.  They were the only children in the restaurant and while this is more of an adult-only setting, older, mature children can do well.  Just don't expect a children's menu.  One child ordered a quesadilla and the other nachos.  Both were delicious.  I ordered the Tampequina.  I wanted to order something different from what I usually get and I'm glad I did.  The sauce on the steak was somewhat sweet and not what I was expecting.  We had to request the nachos and Tampequina to be boxed up and taken home it was so much food.  And they are incredibly generous with the guacamole!  I don't think I've ever seen so much guacamole served for 2 people before!\\n\\nThe server was incredibly nice and attentive.\\n\\nWe sat inside, but the outside was really neat.  At least I *THINK* the outside is...it wasn't attached to the restaurant, rather on the other side of the alley way that leads to the parking lot.  Also, the restrooms were outside, which was a bit unusual.\\n\\nThe only downside I saw was that despite a decent sized parking lot, it was PACKED.  I was lucky to pull up just as a car was pulling out and snagged the only available space.\\n\\n5 stars and I will definitely be returning.\", u'Always a pleasure coming here. My favorite mexican place in the world.... Seriously. Primavera the host is super nice along side a girl I did not know.\\n\\nThe servers are excellent. ( I could be biased because 3 of my cousins work there)\\nValentine the bartender is my favorite!\\nI always get the enchiladas sol. Red sauce is absolutely the BEST but I also love the nueva sauce ( creamy chipotle sauce) and the guajillo sauce ( cream sauce).\\n\\nMargaritas are out of this world and the pollo negro ( chicken breast in a creamy white wine sauce that lays on a bed of spinach sprinkled with goat cheese) is unlike anything you will ever taste.\\n\\nEverything on the menu is Stellar. If you ever in the red wood city area opt for quinto sol one of the sister restaurants.', u'Hands down in my top two favorite Mexican restaurants of the bay area.  I always get the Enchiladas Al Sol and am never disappointed.  The mole is super rich with a great chocolate flavor, so for those who like their mole to be a little less rich, probably not the best option for you.  However, when you mix the mole with the red sauce from the other enchilada, you go to flavor heaven! The habanero margarita is super delicious and they give you three salsas to start which is always great.  Recommend for sure!', u'The parking here is super difficult, especially if you come during dinner crowds. Their parking lot is NOT big enough for their crowds. Good news is you can probably find street parking on the same block, but it can be a long walk/search.\\n\\nMy friends and I came on a Friday evening, and it was super packed. We put our names on the waitlist and waited approximately 15-20 minutes for seats. It\\'s VERY dark inside, which is okay, but I generally don\\'t tend to like that ambiance. On the ceilings there were scary pointy \"sol\" lights that looked slightly precarious, but were beautiful. The entrance has a bar, where people waiting can get drinks or just sit at bar. The drinks looked really good! If I return, I would definitely want to try a drink here.\\n\\nWhen we were seated, we took a look at the menu, and boy, is it pricey! ~$15 AT LEAST per plate. For the amount and quality, it definitely was not worth it for me. Maybe it was the dishes we ordered. We got the chips and with 3x of salsas of varying flavors and spiciness. My favorite is the green one. We got the guacamole, which I thought was only okay. It was kind of bland with no flavor or kick. The avocados tasted fresh though. I\\'ve had much better before. I got the Grandma\\'s Old 19th century chicken, which I didn\\'t particularly enjoy. The chicken was VERY tender and amazing consistency, but the sauce was this odd sweet/savory combination. It came with a side of rice and beans. My friends got the sea bass tacos, which also came with side of rice and beans. The sea bass tacos were really good, they were grilled, had vegetables, and soft flavorful meat.\\n\\nThe food quality was just okay, nothing special for the prices.', u\"This place wasn't bad for Mexican food in the South Bay. For really good Mexican, I'd still head into the city. I thought their margaritas were really good, as were the salsas. The sauce on my shrimp enchiladas were just aight, nothing special.\", u\"Came here tonight with the family for the first time. The 4 of us ordered our mains and an a la carte order of Beans and Rice......Stupid us, the a la carte option was not on the menu but we assumed it would be reasonably priced.\\n\\nThe a la carte order of beans and rice was $17 alone...WTF. I never expected a side of beans  and rice would in very small bowls would cost me MORE THAN MY MAIN COURSE WITH THE SAME small VOLUMN OF RICE AND BEANS.\\n\\nNot cool. For reference, my 2 enchilada meal with rice and beans was $15. The a la carte order of rice and beans was $17 on the bill and came with the same amount of rice and beans as my enchilada meal...minus the enchilada...\\n\\nI'm not very smart, but this reeks of stupid.\\n\\nI take responsibility for not asking about the price. I also hold them responsible for not being transparent about their pricing.\", u\"Great decor, amazing food.\\n\\nJust got home from my first trip to Vive Sol, fianc\\xe9 in tow, and I'm glad we finally checked it out. Interior has lots of yellow light coming from some beautiful punched metal starburst shaped lanterns. Angels adorn the walls, they gaze off into the distance or at some pottery.\\n\\nChips and three types of salsa are placed on your table shortly after you arrive. All quite acidic and at least one of them was spicy. The chips need to be salted.\\n\\nWe ordered and shared the milanesa and the pollo negro. The milanesa was very savory and oily, it was greatly improved by adding a little of the sauce from the pollo negro. The chicken was excellent, the accompanying sauce was tangy and you could really taste the garlic. It came served on top of a bed of spinach and goat cheese crumbles. Beans and rice came with both. We also were offered a small stack of tortillas with our meal and they were delicious, the perfect amount of chewy.\", u\"Every time I go to this place, I love my meal. It's a must-visit whenever I'm in the area.\\n\\nI still order the same thing every time: enchiladas. One with mole, one with guajillo sauce. So delicious. And why are the black beans so wonderful? Something sinful and awesome like bacon fat?? I don't know, but yum.\\n\\nDefinitely a gem. Don't go in a rush... It's not a rushed place.\", u\"The waiting time for dinner on weeknights can be really long, which surprises me. But I guess it shouldn't, since the food here is really good, the restaurant building is adorable, and the prices for Silicon Valley are really reasonable.\\n\\nFree fresh, thin, crispy tortilla chips and salsa. So addictive!\\n\\nThe chocolate cake dessert and the flan are very good.\\n\\nI definitely recommend their mole - very tasty and flavorful.\\n\\nParking when they are busy can be kind of difficult.  The lot definitely is not big enough.\\n\\nI like that they provide you with carafes of water rather than constantly having to get refills.\\n\\nI have been here a few times and will definitely continue going, though probably more for lunch because dinner is so busy all the time.\", u\"Really quality food and drinks. Came here for lunch not expecting it to be this nice but it was a good change. I got the fish tacos (after seeing a yelp pic) and they were really tasty. It tasted fresh vs. other fish tacos. The presentation of the dish was really nice and after seeing my friends dish I want to come back for more... however after a good meal and couple drinks I probably can't afford to come back as often as I would like (pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants).\", u\"Came here again last week for dinner. It's still great! I love the food and ambiance. It would be a great place to take a date.\\n\\nHad the enchiladas Al sol again and a margarita which does not play around ;) Really delicious from start to finish. Great reward after a hard work day. Enjoy this place!\", u'This place is such a hidden gem! I\\'ve lived near mountain view a long time and never been here until now, thanks to yelp. It is hard to find because it\\'s behind another building, but look out for it once you past the Camino Inn.\\n\\nThe decor is very nice, with pretty star lights and a \"pueblo-like\" feel. The place was packed when we went, which is always a good sign of a tasty restaurant. Unfortunately they don\\'t take reservations so it\\'s good to call a head to get a wait time estimate.\\n\\nThe food was delicious and good sized portions. Everything was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.\\n\\nThe caldo de pollo (chicken soup) was great, though a bit on the salty side. There was a lot of chicken and the chicken was nice and tender. We ordered a large and shared between 4 people.\\n\\nI ordered the tomatillo which was good, but nothing amazing. The roasted tomatillo sauce was the best part of this dish. I highly recommend the lomo de puerco, which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful!\\n\\nWe also got a complimentary chocolate cake for a birthday, which was amazing! I don\\'t even like chocolate but I kept wanting more of this. It\\'s not too sweet, but still very moist.', u\"My coworkers really enjoy eating here. I myself, am not a huge fan. The portions here are large when it comes to enchiladas and burritos, otherwise... it's the norm. Their shrimp diabla was not sauced. It does have a good smoky flavor to it, but definitely not the normal sauced up shrimp in spicy sauce. You get 7 good sized shrimps grilled with onions and tomatoes, served with beans and rice.\\n\\nIf you ever want to order guacamole here, don't. You won't get it, and if you do, it's' because you've pestered the waiter to get it before you really eat your meal. Otherwise, expect them to put it on your bill without serving it to you.\\n\\nThe salsa here is never consistent. Sometimes they're spicy, sometimes they are just bland and watery. Not enjoyable when you don't know what to expect. But do expect them to remove this from your table before your bill comes. I don't understand that concept.\\n\\nThere are tons of employees/waiters here. To waive one down, takes a bit of time. Be patient, and make sure you have enough time to wait for service.\\n\\nTo each their own right? This place, is not the place I'd miss once I've left.\", u\"You can not see the name of the restaurant easily from the outside while driving so that makes it hard to find. It is too loud inside and they don't have selection of beans and rice. If you like black beans that might work for you. However service is excellent and portions are very generous. They put a lot of meat in burritos. I also like the lights, not too bright.\", u\"Best enchiladas I have ever had! I have tried all the enchiladas on the menu, and all are unbelievably flavorful. My favorites are the chipotle and guajillo - so well done! And the filling is generous with lots of tender meat.\\n\\nNot only that, the margaritas here are also amazing. (Coworkers have mentioned enjoying the tequila selection, but I personally haven't tried many here.)\\n\\nDecor is also fantastic, as well as the cute patio. It's always lively and fun with great service!\", u'Vive Sol has now become part of my regular rotation, as the food and experience is so superior compared with the generally underwhelming food scene of MV. Vive Sol is unassuming from the front, but when you drive into the back courtyard you are in an oasis of a parking lot, full of flora, foliage and delicious smelling honeysuckles. Both the decor and atmosphere are bright, energetic and loud and the food is simple yet delicious and a fantastic bang for your buck.\\nThe pescado a la mulata is a standout and make sure to try two different sauces when you order the enchiladas (mole and al guajillo are my favorites).', u'Very tasty food with great ambiance.  Patio seating was fantastic except there was no music.', u\"Had good dinner here. We tried some margaritas and sangria, both were good.\\nI ordered tacos, which weren't really on menu, but ordered one each with chicken, pork and beef. Chicken and beef were great, pork was okay. The salsa with the chips was really, really good.\", u\"Drinks are very good and the food is great, too.\\n\\nThe service was really nice and I like how it has both indoor and outdoor seating. We came here early on a Friday night and it wasn't super packet, yet.\\n\\nI really liked my margarita and they give a lot in the glass. :)  My only issue was that I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and it came with no sauce; it was covered with beans.  I like having beans with my enchiladas but it was rather dry. I got some of the tomatillo salsa on the side but it wasn't the same experience.  I would definitely come here again, but I will probably order something else next time.\", u\"Wow this place is good.\\n\\nWe went on a Sunday night and didn't need to wait. I'm assuming Fri and Sat nights are a lot busier.\\n\\n- Red Sangria is a must try.\\n- The chalupas were not what we were expecting, but they were great\\n- enchiladas del sol were great.\\n\\nOverall one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in the area.\", u\"After looking over Yelp for a new place to try in Mountain View, I ended up at this restaurant and it was a great experience.\\n\\nYou really have to keep an eye out for it on El Camino, and there is just a small parking lot in the very back, so I highly recommend non-peak hours if you don't like hassling with waiting for a parking spot.\\n\\nThey have two dining areas, a covered all outdoor dining area to one side that is really lovely and a regular indoor restaurant.  We ate inside this time. The decor is really fantastic and creates a great ambiance.  They have nice big windows and they had them open during the summer when we went, which created a great breeze.  The have an entrance through the restaurant in the back from the parking lot and off El Camino too.  There is also a full bar.\\n\\nThe support staff service was great.  We got a bottle of water on our table, a basket of chips and 3 different kinds of salsa asap with the menus.  The support staff would consistently swing by and offer refills of water from the bottle, extra salsa of the one we preferred more than others, and more and more chips.  \\n\\nThe server was ok, kind of aloof and actually pretty slow to respond.  It took awhile to get our order taken, and also for the bill to arrive.  We had to flag down our server via the support staff actually, to make it happen.   Without the support staff helping so much, I really am not sure that I would have enjoyed the experience so much with the quality of the service from just the server.\\n\\nThe food was awesome!!  The rice is vegetarian, which is great.  A lot of mexican restaurants actually use chicken broth, but I inquired and this place does not.  \\n\\nI ordered some cheese enchiladas mexicanas and the sauce and everything was really delicious. It was just enough food too, not too much or too little.  My husband ordered the seafood soup with corn dumplings in it and he loved it.  The only thing is they don't remove the shrimp tails so you have to handle them when they are quite hot from the soup's heat - which isn't super fun and take them off.\\n\\nOverall, it was great.  The prices were very good too.  I will definitely be back and its going on my list of top places when I want mexican food in Mountain View.\\n\\nSo happy to find another great place, and thanks to all the Yelp reviewers too for pointing me in the direction of this place !\", u'After being a favorite of mine for years...it pains me to say they have gone down hill recently.\\n\\nCons\\nGuacamole was tasteless...either they are using cheaper ingredients or some kind of fillers. Chips were stale like they were left out from the night before. The margaritas tasted like they are now using a cheap mix and unfortunately had very little alcohol.\\nThe entree I ordered had a hair on the side of the plate (by now I could have used the alcohol from a decent margarita )\\nWay overpriced for the food quality\\nWait was a good 30 minutes and, just not worth it.\\n\\nPros\\nThe decor is delightful\\nParking is easy\\n\\nNot sure if it is new management or current management is getting greedy and going with cheap ingredients and getting sloppy with cleanliness practices!\\n\\nAt this point, I would recommend passing up this place just driving down the street and going to Estrellitas...']"

Called in my order & I\\'m told that\\'s fine we will deliver before 9. Come 845 (an hour later) still no sign of my food. I call & the lady tells me \"5 minutes\" so I wait. Around 8:55 I call again & she tells me oh she will leave in 10 minutes. Angry that I have to wait so long, I tell her forget it I can come pick up in a few mins myself. I start driving to the restaurant around 9:05 a coworker that was working late calls me & says your food is here. I call back and find out the lady on the phone confused my order with another. Luckily the right order made it to my job but an hour and half later!!!\\n\\nI wish I could give this place no stars but since yelp lets you do 1 star, blahh! The extra star is because their Chowmein & fried rice really hit the spot. Tofu was too dry and firm. Basil eggplant was really tasty & flavorful so they earned an extra star but I will think 100 times over before placing another delivery order with these people!', u\"Really good Chinese at a good price. It varies depending on your visit if it's good or great but I enjoy it regardless and keep coming back. The broccoli and beef is delicious.\", u\"HORRIBLE!

    "FIELD4":"[u\"6 stars for service. 3.5-4 for food. I'll avg it off.\\n\\nThe people who work here are so great. Some of the friendliest, most attentive service I've ever had! I usually come here for a quick breakfast on weekends. Have tried the fried chicken and waffles and the burger so far.\\n\\nChicken and waffles was okay, burger was quality. Decently priced and a solid spot to stop.\", u'I ordered over easy eggs, orange juice, and coffee.\\n\\nCoffee is good. Orange juice is freshly squeezed. Eggs are OK - just a tiny bit overcooked. About 3.5-4 stars for food quality.\\n\\nAnd zero stars for staff. They are inattentive and slow. One really needs to actually catch them to make an order, to get an ordered food, to finally get silverware, to get a check, to get the credit card back, etc.', u'Overall: Average\\n\\nI had a little time to kill before heading back to work so I decided to try Bajis Cafe. It started off okay, was seated in the outdoor enclosed patio. I sat and waited for 5 minutes before a server finally came over to greet me and take my drink order. At this point I was ready to order. My order was put in and came out in under 10 mins, very fast ticket time.\\n\\nThe food portion seemed a bit small but, it did fill me up. The quality was good, nothing that makes me jump out.\\n\\nAverage experience along with decent food. I would consider coming back to try something different.', u'This place is located in a decent and business area.\\nVery good Breakfast and Brunch place.\\nI visited this place 3 times.\\nFood tastes good. you need to order the best stuff they have.\\nOmlets are very good here.', u\"Many of the breakfast places around here are three stars, but this one is slightly better than the rest -- and that makes enough difference. It is often very crowded, but tables are cleared very quickly and service fast but courteous. Their signs say they have Peet's coffee, but it's extremely bitter -- probably standard when it's been sitting for who knows how long. Served very hot, which I liked. I usually get the chicken fried steak with gravy, eggs, toast, and hash, which is a very big and filling meal.\", u\"Well, probably just had the most disappointing brunch to date here.  Pretty sad since this had become my go-to brunch spot and I would always bring friends here.  \\n\\nOur food came out about 10 minutes apart, and it would have been longer had I not said something.  I had to flag a waiter because they hadn't noticed the time lag at all.  Hubby's food came out cold.  My pancakes tasted like they had rotten bananas in them making them pretty hard to put down.\\n\\nThey said they were sorry, but their sorry didn't extend as far as the check which they could have given us at least a little discount on since our meal was just plain bad.  I gave them a chance to make things right but they clearly didn't care about me as a customer.\\n\\nWill not be returning here and I wouldn't recommend trying it.  I will take my brunching elsewhere.\", u\"Worth it! They have such a nice place here, a nice patio and inside kept clean at all times. The service was great right away, they make sure you're well taken care of. When you're seated and go through your menu they make sure to recommend dishes and make sure you're aware of what you'll be consuming. The food was delicious, I enjoyed my meal and so did my boyfriend we went with the basics Ham and eggs and 2 pancakes 2 eggs.\\nWhat made me give this place the full 5 stars is that they also recycle water. They don't just throw it away to waste. This place knows we are in a drought and is conserving as much as they can. Thumbs up to you guys. Thanks for giving a 5 star performance.\", u\"This little breakfast joint is nestled in a more industrial part of Mountain View where you wouldn't think to find a diner, but the place was poppin' on a Sunday morning and with good reason -- the food and atmosphere is friendly, warm, and delicious!\\n\\nI'm not gonna lie, I only came here for the chicken and waffles and didn't really bother looking much at the other items on the breakfast menu. The chicken was DELICIOUS!! I got 2 drumsticks (dark meat ftw) that were definitely brined before and had this super crispy skin on it. I prefer my fried chicken NOT breaded, so this was right up my alley. The waffle, however, was a bit disappointing. It was flat, doughy, chewy, and a bit difficult to cut into. If they could up their waffle game to something crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside, this chicky wizzy woulda been a home run. However, the chicken is good enough to warrant a repeat visit in the past.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the country fried steak with a biscuit since we saw so many gravy-slathered pictures on the Yelp page. Although I only had a bite, the empty plate at the end of the meal proved that this was a solid dish.\\n\\nThe coffee is also from Peet's, so it's a good, solid brew!\", u\"If you can't find anything at the hour, do go. Nothing to rave about.\", u\"Came here for brunch after church with a few friends. We got seated immediately (party of 6). There are so many options on the menu, mostly breakfast, but also burgers and sandwiches as well. I got two biscuits and gravy, along with two over easy eggs. Unfortunately, my food was served cold or lukewarm at best since it had that glaze/sheen to it (when sauce or gravy is cold). Food was mediocre and bland to me-definitely had better biscuits and gravy (but then again, I grew up in the South). However, my bf's chicken and waffles was decent and served hot, so I guess it depends on what you get and if you are here with a large group. Portions were decently large. Service was exceptional- they were so friendly and kind, and constantly refilled our water. Breakfast entrees are around $8-11. Overall Bajis Cafe is A-OK, a solid 3 star rating.\", u\"I'm not really sure how this got 4 stars. It's not really that great. I had the skillet with salmon and I don't feel it was that special. The salmon was ok. The eggs were cooked fine. The vegetables were nothing special. I also tried the pancakes and they messed up that order. We asked for blueberries AND bananas in the pancakes but they only made it with blueberries. They fixed it by giving us a plate of bananas but that wasn't what we ordered. The menu looks just average. Maybe I need to go back and try the friend chicken and waffles. But from what I've tried so far, there's nothing special here. If you want a nice brunch place, check out Saint Michael's alley or Pastis in Palo Alto. They're not that far from here.\", u\"Went here for breakfast with my friend and got the chicken and waffles. DELICIOUS. We just went here since it was closeby in the area and then were pleasantly surprised how great the food was. The chicken was crispy and the waffle was great.\\n\\nI would definitely go back. We also got mimosas. They don't do unlimited but they pour pretty large portions in the glass.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere and we had to wait like 10 minutes for a table which isn't bad for Sunday at prime brunch time.\", u\"Food was good but my wife's eggs were runny.  He was a bit combative regarding questions with meal.  Chicken fried steak was good and the linguica is excellent\\nPS- the owner, Baji, asked me about my review and was sincere about hearing more about my review. I explained the situation and he was very kind. He appreciated the feedback and I can tell he is passionate about his business and the food he makes.  I love to see owners active in their business. It truly makes the difference as you can tell by this establishments' reviews and stars.\", u'What a hidden gem! We tried the corn beef hash and the biscuit breakfast sandwiches and it was delish! Our food came out very quickly but somehow flagging someone down for a check at the end proved to be difficult. The ambiance is nothing memorable and feels like a blast from the past but the food and service are worth stopping by for.', u'I came here with my mom and our good friend yesterday after church. I found this place just by searching for brunch places around the Mountain View/Sunnyvale/Los Altos area and came across this classic gem. The staff was very nice and attentive towards us. I read here that a reviewer said that this place had a 80s/90s vibe to it when you walk in. I don\\'t know why, but I definitely felt like I stepped back into time when walking in there. Maybe it was just the look of the restaurant and the 80s/90s mix of great music they were playing?\\n\\nI digress. I had the \"West Coast Scramble\" which wasn\\'t too bad. It was slightly watery though because there were diced tomatoes cooked with it. My friend had their Chicken n\\' Waffles which looked INCREDIBLY good so I decided to order some myself to go. I couldn\\'t help myself but to take a bite of the chicken before leaving. And OMG....I don\\'t know how or WHAT they season their fried chicken with but it was pretty amazing.\\n\\nOverall, will definitely be back for more brunchin! Thank you Yelp once again for helping me discover these hidden small restaurant gems around the South Bay! :-)', u\"When it comes to breakfast, this is some\\nOf the yummiest breakfast food I have ever had! I have not tried something that I didn't like. I think what takes their food above the rest is that it is made with love and hard work. The staff is so kind and really cares about your experience at the restaurant. I will keep coming back!\", u'Love their corn beef hash. The staff is super friend and quick. Their pancakes are also really tasty and have a slight vanilla taste.', u\"Pretty damn good food! Salsa is amazing and the customer service is superb. Careful with the salsa, it's very spicy!

Great way to soak up our 4th of July alcohol. The staff was very friendly and on point with their coffee refills. Now it's time to go back to bed.\", u\"A good brunch spot with no line?! That alone gives this place a 5 star rating. Awesome chicken waffles, club sandwich has perfectly cooked bacon that is soft yet crunchy. Fresh squeezed orange juice and grapefruit? Check!

The server kept going back and forth and kept arguing. I think the only good dish there was the cheese toast but that\\'s pretty much it.

I've always had trouble finding good brunch near me, and then this unexpected little place showed up! What a gem. It's on a random location on MIddlefield but the waiters and the food are fantastic.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered a vanilla milkshake, arnold palmer, biscuits with gravy, fried chicken and waffles, and blueberry pancakes.

Baji the owner I assume is really nice and welcoming. My sweetie and I were seated outside but it was chilly even though there were little heat lamps out. They took us inside no problem.\\n\\nWe both ordered the country fried steak. Neither of us like to share :P It also comes with your choice of eggs and bread. I had it with eggs sunny side up and sourdough. The dish came out there were 4 slices of bread on my plate. That's a lot for my belly so I only ate 2 pieces. The service is really great! Everyone works together and I would gladly come back here every weekend!\", u\"For a Saturday we were seated quickly. Like all the other reviews the customer service was excellent and the owner(?) was very warm and welcoming.\\n\\nHubby's country fried steak was great and the hash brown was excellent.\\n\\nMy eggs were over easy and runny as I like it and the ham had great grill marks. The only thing I will not order again is the the waffles, they were cold and soggy.\\n\\nOtherwise, I will try it again.\", u\"My go-to place for Chicken and Waffles! Kind of a hidden little gem. Customer service is fantastic. Food is always great...but I've only ever had the chicken and waffles.\", u'Came in for a brunch with my family. We had a good experience! Very homey, neighborhood joint kind of vibe. We ordered a variety of items, notably the corned beef hash and the chicken and waffles. The food was good, but not great. My favorite part by far and away was the fried chicken. Perfectly seasoned, I just wish there was more of it! The waffle was a bit dense for my taste. The corned beef was standard, but yummy! My dad and I got lattes (they serve peets!) and they were nicely sized. Overall, a good meal with great service and good food.', u\"This is a very local neighborhood diner. The staff is very friendly and service is great.\\nHowever, food is quite average. Ingredients are fresh but the taste is just average. I would really like to give them an extra star but cannot quite justify it...\\nWe ordered omlette, scramble and gravy, egg sandwich. Good thing is there isn't a wait...\", u\"What excellent service (thanks Manuel), warmth and food all in one location! My coffee cup was never 1/3 way down & my bros water was constantly refilled!\\nThe food was fast & delicious - but i regret telling my brother to get the chicken and waffles because I SHOULDVE HAD IT!!! Dang... Next time, I'm gonna have that.\\nThe reason why this place didn't get 5 stars is because my eggs Benedicts yoke didn't ooooze therefore it wasn't done properly.\\n\\nAnyway - for sure coming back for breakfast\", u\"Don't order waffles here. I love waffles so it was super disappointing.  Chick is nice but bland.  Eggs over hard was not hard.  Smoothie was huge.\", u\"I saw many good reviews here, and finally tried.\\nI stopped here for breakfast before heading to backpackin in Big Sur.\\nSo I was qualified to have a big breakfast. I got a cup of coffee and strawerry pancake. It was good! Pancake was big enough for a big eater. I wish the pancake had whip cream as well in addtion to butter, but it's ok.\\nThe service was friendly.  It is a little expensive (pancake + coffee $15). Wish it was $12-13.\", u\"seemed like a nice place, but I'll have to give it another try as my waffles weren't great- I couldn't cut them w/ a knife- they were rubbery. But the eggs and sausages were good. Maybe I should have gotten the pancakes.\", u\"Good service. All the workers are friendly. Food comes out in a timely manner. They constantly ask you if you're okay and need anything and refill your drinks. Good brunch. My fianc\\xe9 always gets the pancakes and all their omelettes and griddles are good.\", u\"I love this place just found my new dish\\nMexican sundae.\\nService is great don't have to ask for second cup of coffee.\\n\\nStaff very good and friendly\\n\\nRobert\", u\"SUPER good food and fast service!\\n\\nI had a meatlover's omelette which had lots of flavor, but wasn't crazy greasy. Coffee was nice and strong. We sat outside and it was really comfortable.\\n\\nWent a little bit early to beat the crowd and got seated right away. I'll definitely go back.\", u\"Brunch gives meaning to life. So when I came here on a Saturday for brunch I was obviously thrilled. The restaurant was pretty busy since it was the weekend. I ordered the chicken & waffles special with a side of scrambled eggs for $12.95. It came with two decent sized pieces of fried chicken and one large waffle. The serving of eggs seemed a little small at first but man never underestimate how filling chicken and waffles can be. So it was actually quite a bit of food for the price. The chicken was very tender and tasty. The waffle was average. It wasn't one of those giant crispy on the outside soft on the inside Belgian waffle behemoths. It seemed like an ordinary waffle from a waffle maker. They also didn't give us any syrup for it but that generally doesn't bother me since I'm not a fan of syrup. Also coffee. They have good coffee (Peets I believe) and also free refills on coffee so that's always a bonus. Overall this was a decent place to get chicken and waffles. I would probably come here again since I live pretty close by.\", u\"6 stars for service. 3.5-4 for food. I'll avg it off.\\n\\nThe people who work here are so great. Some of the friendliest, most attentive service I've ever had! I usually come here for a quick breakfast on weekends. Have tried the fried chicken and waffles and the burger so far.\\n\\nChicken and waffles was okay, burger was quality. Decently priced and a solid spot to stop.\", u'I ordered over easy eggs, orange juice, and coffee.\\n\\nCoffee is good. Orange juice is freshly squeezed. Eggs are OK - just a tiny bit overcooked. About 3.5-4 stars for food quality.\\n\\nAnd zero stars for staff. They are inattentive and slow. One really needs to actually catch them to make an order, to get an ordered food, to finally get silverware, to get a check, to get the credit card back, etc.', u'Overall: Average\\n\\nI had a little time to kill before heading back to work so I decided to try Bajis Cafe. It started off okay, was seated in the outdoor enclosed patio. I sat and waited for 5 minutes before a server finally came over to greet me and take my drink order. At this point I was ready to order. My order was put in and came out in under 10 mins, very fast ticket time.\\n\\nThe food portion seemed a bit small but, it did fill me up. The quality was good, nothing that makes me jump out.\\n\\nAverage experience along with decent food. I would consider coming back to try something different.', u'This place is located in a decent and business area.\\nVery good Breakfast and Brunch place.\\nI visited this place 3 times.\\nFood tastes good. you need to order the best stuff they have.\\nOmlets are very good here.', u\"Many of the breakfast places around here are three stars, but this one is slightly better than the rest -- and that makes enough difference. It is often very crowded, but tables are cleared very quickly and service fast but courteous. Their signs say they have Peet's coffee, but it's extremely bitter -- probably standard when it's been sitting for who knows how long. Served very hot, which I liked. I usually get the chicken fried steak with gravy, eggs, toast, and hash, which is a very big and filling meal.\", u\"Well, probably just had the most disappointing brunch to date here.  Pretty sad since this had become my go-to brunch spot and I would always bring friends here.  \\n\\nOur food came out about 10 minutes apart, and it would have been longer had I not said something.  I had to flag a waiter because they hadn't noticed the time lag at all.  Hubby's food came out cold.  My pancakes tasted like they had rotten bananas in them making them pretty hard to put down.\\n\\nThey said they were sorry, but their sorry didn't extend as far as the check which they could have given us at least a little discount on since our meal was just plain bad.  I gave them a chance to make things right but they clearly didn't care about me as a customer.\\n\\nWill not be returning here and I wouldn't recommend trying it.  I will take my brunching elsewhere.\", u\"Worth it! They have such a nice place here, a nice patio and inside kept clean at all times. The service was great right away, they make sure you're well taken care of.

I would really like to give them an extra star but cannot quite justify it...\\nWe ordered omlette, scramble and gravy, egg sandwich. Good thing is there isn't a wait...\", u\"What excellent service (thanks Manuel), warmth and food all in one location! My coffee cup was never 1/3 way down & my bros water was constantly refilled!\\nThe food was fast & delicious - but i regret telling my brother to get the chicken and waffles because I SHOULDVE HAD IT!!! Dang... Next time, I'm gonna have that.\\nThe reason why this place didn't get 5 stars is because my eggs Benedicts yoke didn't ooooze therefore it wasn't done properly.\\n\\nAnyway - for sure coming back for breakfast\", u\"Don't order waffles here. I love waffles so it was super disappointing.  Chick is nice but bland.  Eggs over hard was not hard.  Smoothie was huge.\", u\"I saw many good reviews here, and finally tried.\\nI stopped here for breakfast before heading to backpackin in Big Sur.\\nSo I was qualified to have a big breakfast. I got a cup of coffee and strawerry pancake. It was good! Pancake was big enough for a big eater. I wish the pancake had whip cream as well in addtion to butter, but it's ok.\\nThe service was friendly.  It is a little expensive (pancake + coffee $15). Wish it was $12-13.\", u\"seemed like a nice place, but I'll have to give it another try as my waffles weren't great- I couldn't cut them w/ a knife- they were rubbery. But the eggs and sausages were good. Maybe I should have gotten the pancakes.\", u\"Good service. All the workers are friendly. Food comes out in a timely manner. They constantly ask you if you're okay and need anything and refill your drinks. Good brunch. My fianc\\xe9 always gets the pancakes and all their omelettes and griddles are good.\", u\"I love this place just found my new dish\\nMexican sundae.\\nService is great don't have to ask for second cup of coffee.\\n\\nStaff very good and friendly\\n\\nRobert\", u\"SUPER good food and fast service!\\n\\nI had a meatlover's omelette which had lots of flavor, but wasn't crazy greasy. Coffee was nice and strong. We sat outside and it was really comfortable.\\n\\nWent a little bit early to beat the crowd and got seated right away. I'll definitely go back.\", u\"Brunch gives meaning to life. So when I came here on a Saturday for brunch I was obviously thrilled. The restaurant was pretty busy since it was the weekend. I ordered the chicken & waffles special with a side of scrambled eggs for $12.95. It came with two decent sized pieces of fried chicken and one large waffle. The serving of eggs seemed a little small at first but man never underestimate how filling chicken and waffles can be. So it was actually quite a bit of food for the price. The chicken was very tender and tasty. The waffle was average. It wasn't one of those giant crispy on the outside soft on the inside Belgian waffle behemoths. It seemed like an ordinary waffle from a waffle maker. They also didn't give us any syrup for it but that generally doesn't bother me since I'm not a fan of syrup. Also coffee. They have good coffee (Peets I believe) and also free refills on coffee so that's always a bonus. Overall this was a decent place to get chicken and waffles. I would probably come here again since I live pretty close by.\", u\"6 stars for service. 3.5-4 for food. I'll avg it off.\\n\\nThe people who work here are so great. Some of the friendliest, most attentive service I've ever had! I usually come here for a quick breakfast on weekends. Have tried the fried chicken and waffles and the burger so far.\\n\\nChicken and waffles was okay, burger was quality. Decently priced and a solid spot to stop.\", u'I ordered over easy eggs, orange juice, and coffee.\\n\\nCoffee is good. Orange juice is freshly squeezed. Eggs are OK - just a tiny bit overcooked. About 3.5-4 stars for food quality.\\n\\nAnd zero stars for staff. They are inattentive and slow. One really needs to actually catch them to make an order, to get an ordered food, to finally get silverware, to get a check, to get the credit card back, etc.', u'Overall: Average\\n\\nI had a little time to kill before heading back to work so I decided to try Bajis Cafe. It started off okay, was seated in the outdoor enclosed patio. I sat and waited for 5 minutes before a server finally came over to greet me and take my drink order. At this point I was ready to order. My order was put in and came out in under 10 mins, very fast ticket time.\\n\\nThe food portion seemed a bit small but, it did fill me up. The quality was good, nothing that makes me jump out.\\n\\nAverage experience along with decent food. I would consider coming back to try something different.', u'This place is located in a decent and business area.\\nVery good Breakfast and Brunch place.\\nI visited this place 3 times.\\nFood tastes good. you need to order the best stuff they have.\\nOmlets are very good here.', u\"Many of the breakfast places around here are three stars, but this one is slightly better than the rest -- and that makes enough difference. It is often very crowded, but tables are cleared very quickly and service fast but courteous. Their signs say they have Peet's coffee, but it's extremely bitter -- probably standard when it's been sitting for who knows how long. Served very hot, which I liked. I usually get the chicken fried steak with gravy, eggs, toast, and hash, which is a very big and filling meal.\", u\"Well, probably just had the most disappointing brunch to date here.  Pretty sad since this had become my go-to brunch spot and I would always bring friends here.  \\n\\nOur food came out about 10 minutes apart, and it would have been longer had I not said something.  I had to flag a waiter because they hadn't noticed the time lag at all.  Hubby's food came out cold.  My pancakes tasted like they had rotten bananas in them making them pretty hard to put down.\\n\\nThey said they were sorry, but their sorry didn't extend as far as the check which they could have given us at least a little discount on since our meal was just plain bad.  I gave them a chance to make things right but they clearly didn't care about me as a customer.\\n\\nWill not be returning here and I wouldn't recommend trying it.  I will take my brunching elsewhere.\", u\"Worth it! They have such a nice place here, a nice patio and inside kept clean at all times. The service was great right away, they make sure you're well taken care of. When you're seated and go through your menu they make sure to recommend dishes and make sure you're aware of what you'll be consuming. The food was delicious, I enjoyed my meal and so did my boyfriend we went with the basics Ham and eggs and 2 pancakes 2 eggs.\\nWhat made me give this place the full 5 stars is that they also recycle water. They don't just throw it away to waste. This place knows we are in a drought and is conserving as much as they can. Thumbs up to you guys. Thanks for giving a 5 star performance.\", u\"This little breakfast joint is nestled in a more industrial part of Mountain View where you wouldn't think to find a diner, but the place was poppin' on a Sunday morning and with good reason -- the food and atmosphere is friendly, warm, and delicious!\\n\\nI'm not gonna lie, I only came here for the chicken and waffles and didn't really bother looking much at the other items on the breakfast menu. The chicken was DELICIOUS!! I got 2 drumsticks (dark meat ftw) that were definitely brined before and had this super crispy skin on it. I prefer my fried chicken NOT breaded, so this was right up my alley. The waffle, however, was a bit disappointing. It was flat, doughy, chewy, and a bit difficult to cut into. If they could up their waffle game to something crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside, this chicky wizzy woulda been a home run. However, the chicken is good enough to warrant a repeat visit in the past.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the country fried steak with a biscuit since we saw so many gravy-slathered pictures on the Yelp page. Although I only had a bite, the empty plate at the end of the meal proved that this was a solid dish.\\n\\nThe coffee is also from Peet's, so it's a good, solid brew!\", u\"If you can't find anything at the hour, do go. Nothing to rave about.\", u\"Came here for brunch after church with a few friends. We got seated immediately (party of 6). There are so many options on the menu, mostly breakfast, but also burgers and sandwiches as well. I got two biscuits and gravy, along with two over easy eggs. Unfortunately, my food was served cold or lukewarm at best since it had that glaze/sheen to it (when sauce or gravy is cold). Food was mediocre and bland to me-definitely had better biscuits and gravy (but then again, I grew up in the South). However, my bf's chicken and waffles was decent and served hot, so I guess it depends on what you get and if you are here with a large group. Portions were decently large. Service was exceptional- they were so friendly and kind, and constantly refilled our water. Breakfast entrees are around $8-11. Overall Bajis Cafe is A-OK, a solid 3 star rating.\", u\"I'm not really sure how this got 4 stars. It's not really that great. I had the skillet with salmon and I don't feel it was that special. The salmon was ok. The eggs were cooked fine. The vegetables were nothing special. I also tried the pancakes and they messed up that order. We asked for blueberries AND bananas in the pancakes but they only made it with blueberries. They fixed it by giving us a plate of bananas but that wasn't what we ordered. The menu looks just average. Maybe I need to go back and try the friend chicken and waffles. But from what I've tried so far, there's nothing special here. If you want a nice brunch place, check out Saint Michael's alley or Pastis in Palo Alto. They're not that far from here.\", u\"Went here for breakfast with my friend and got the chicken and waffles. DELICIOUS. We just went here since it was closeby in the area and then were pleasantly surprised how great the food was. The chicken was crispy and the waffle was great.\\n\\nI would definitely go back. We also got mimosas. They don't do unlimited but they pour pretty large portions in the glass.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere and we had to wait like 10 minutes for a table which isn't bad for Sunday at prime brunch time.\", u\"Food was good but my wife's eggs were runny.  He was a bit combative regarding questions with meal.  Chicken fried steak was good and the linguica is excellent\\nPS- the owner, Baji, asked me about my review and was sincere about hearing more about my review. I explained the situation and he was very kind. He appreciated the feedback and I can tell he is passionate about his business and the food he makes.  I love to see owners active in their business. It truly makes the difference as you can tell by this establishments' reviews and stars.\", u'What a hidden gem! We tried the corn beef hash and the biscuit breakfast sandwiches and it was delish! Our food came out very quickly but somehow flagging someone down for a check at the end proved to be difficult. The ambiance is nothing memorable and feels like a blast from the past but the food and service are worth stopping by for.', u'I came here with my mom and our good friend yesterday after church. I found this place just by searching for brunch places around the Mountain View/Sunnyvale/Los Altos area and came across this classic gem. The staff was very nice and attentive towards us. I read here that a reviewer said that this place had a 80s/90s vibe to it when you walk in. I don\\'t know why, but I definitely felt like I stepped back into time when walking in there. Maybe it was just the look of the restaurant and the 80s/90s mix of great music they were playing?\\n\\nI digress. I had the \"West Coast Scramble\" which wasn\\'t too bad. It was slightly watery though because there were diced tomatoes cooked with it. My friend had their Chicken n\\' Waffles which looked INCREDIBLY good so I decided to order some myself to go. I couldn\\'t help myself but to take a bite of the chicken before leaving. And OMG....I don\\'t know how or WHAT they season their fried chicken with but it was pretty amazing.\\n\\nOverall, will definitely be back for more brunchin! Thank you Yelp once again for helping me discover these hidden small restaurant gems around the South Bay! :-)', u\"When it comes to breakfast, this is some\\nOf the yummiest breakfast food I have ever had! I have not tried something that I didn't like. I think what takes their food above the rest is that it is made with love and hard work. The staff is so kind and really cares about your experience at the restaurant. I will keep coming back!\", u'Love their corn beef hash. The staff is super friend and quick. Their pancakes are also really tasty and have a slight vanilla taste.', u\"Pretty damn good food! Salsa is amazing and the customer service is superb. Careful with the salsa, it's very spicy! I love breakfast/brunch spots and this one tops my list! I'll be back soon!\", u\"Another great find on yelp. Best chilaquiles I've had in the bay area. Boyfriend had the buckwheat pancakes. Great way to soak up our 4th of July alcohol. The staff was very friendly and on point with their coffee refills. Now it's time to go back to bed.\", u\"A good brunch spot with no line?! That alone gives this place a 5 star rating. Awesome chicken waffles, club sandwich has perfectly cooked bacon that is soft yet crunchy. Fresh squeezed orange juice and grapefruit? Check! This place has an extra extensive menu and will most likely satisfy anyone's brunch cravings. Did I also mention the friendly smiles and great customer service?\", u\"Don't tell anyone but Bajis is my go to restaurants. Good Breakfast until 3PM. Also they allow dogs within their patio dinning\", u\"Running out of places to eat breakfast in our vicinity again we ventured out a bit. When we arrived around 8:30 there were only two people. By 9am it was a full blown carnival!\\n\\nI can understand why. First of the service was noticeably awesome. Very polite but warm.  The place is not that big. It fits the description of cozy. Although they have enough staff more than a restaurant bigger in size!\\n\\nI had the corned beef hash. It's under Bajis breakfast special. It comes with a side of potatoes or hash brown, eggs, two strips of bacon and two pieces of toast. $10.45.\\n\\nThe food is very good. Nothing unusual in presentation but fast. Here they're service centric. Our glass of water and Adam's coffee cup was never empty. We came out of there full, relaxed and definitely a fan!\\n\\nDuh moment: Their special of the day is whatever you want.  They will make it for you!\", u'We were a party of 9 and ordered quite a few things which not to mention were just A-OK. They messed up one of my friends order and when we were trying to clarify  the original order , the server was very rude and told my friend and I quote \"  stop talking as I am talking\". The server kept going back and forth and kept arguing. I think the only good dish there was the cheese toast but that\\'s pretty much it. Not a Fan', u'Good breakfast BUT...\\n\\nThe menu posted online has old prices. Their current prices are significantly higher. I hate dishonest bait and switch places. Hate them.\\n\\nThe menu on their website may be right but the one on Yelp is definitely very misleading and WRONG!', u'Yo-\\n\\nWife and my first visit to Bajis Caf\\xe9.  Kinda disappointed with the lack of service and their pricing of the check - but the food was good - not great - but good.\\n\\nPlace was about 1/3 full - and still the service was lacking - coffee refill did not happen until end of the meal when we questioned the $3.25 charge for coffee - and when the sign clearly states $2.75 for \"bottomless refills with food service\" (the charge was reversed when we brought it to the waiters attention.)\\n\\nI had corned beef hash and eggs over medium (which were a little undercooked - and the corned beef obviously came out of a can) and the wife had an omelette which she said was good.\\n\\nWe would come back to give them another chance-eh!!', u\"Mmm solid brunch place in the Bay! I've always had trouble finding good brunch near me, and then this unexpected little place showed up! What a gem. It's on a random location on MIddlefield but the waiters and the food are fantastic.\\n\\nMy friend and I ordered a vanilla milkshake, arnold palmer, biscuits with gravy, fried chicken and waffles, and blueberry pancakes. The food was delish and the portions were insanely large. The milkshake comes in a super long glass, the pancakes are light, fluffy, and delicious, and the biscuits and gravy go great with the fried chicken. All in all, the food definitely hit the spot.\\n\\nThe waitstaff is also super nice. My friend and I hung out there for almost three hours and they checked up on us, offered us water, and were really polite and not pushy at all. The menu is also insanely long--took us forever to order and there's still a lot of stuff that I would love to try.\\n\\ntldr; amazing brunch place tucked away on middlefield, absolutely worth a visit if you're in the area!!\", u\"This is a great local fare breakfast staple. It has some real busy weekend mornings.\\nStaff:\\nAlways have been friendly and even on the busiest days are doing their best to try to keep your coffee full and make sure that you have what you need.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe food is dependable it's breakfast. Although I would have to say I would skip the corn beef it's a regular canned product. Good waffles and pancakes and the standard breakfast share of eggs and bacon you can't go wrong.\", u\"AWESOME SERVICE!\\n\\nCame here on a whim through Yelp and boy was I glad! Baji the owner I assume is really nice and welcoming. My sweetie and I were seated outside but it was chilly even though there were little heat lamps out. They took us inside no problem.\\n\\nWe both ordered the country fried steak. Neither of us like to share :P It also comes with your choice of eggs and bread. I had it with eggs sunny side up and sourdough. The dish came out there were 4 slices of bread on my plate. That's a lot for my belly so I only ate 2 pieces. The service is really great! Everyone works together and I would gladly come back here every weekend!\", u\"For a Saturday we were seated quickly. Like all the other reviews the customer service was excellent and the owner(?) was very warm and welcoming.\\n\\nHubby's country fried steak was great and the hash brown was excellent.\\n\\nMy eggs were over easy and runny as I like it and the ham had great grill marks. The only thing I will not order again is the the waffles, they were cold and soggy.\\n\\nOtherwise, I will try it again.\", u\"My go-to place for Chicken and Waffles! Kind of a hidden little gem. Customer service is fantastic. Food is always great...but I've only ever had the chicken and waffles.\", u'Came in for a brunch with my family. We had a good experience! Very homey, neighborhood joint kind of vibe. We ordered a variety of items, notably the corned beef hash and the chicken and waffles. The food was good, but not great. My favorite part by far and away was the fried chicken. Perfectly seasoned, I just wish there was more of it! The waffle was a bit dense for my taste. The corned beef was standard, but yummy!

I noticed the Manager, Andre, who is aways awesome and helpful, has been managing the drive-through windows now every time I'm there.  It looks like he took the review below seriously and wants to make sure it doesn't happen again.  I know his name because he always greets everyone over the ordering speaker with a great, fun welcome and introduces himself.\\n\\nChicken is aways good.  Building is beautiful.  Andre always has a smile and is extremely courteous.  For a fast-food chain, I love coming here.  Two this up!  And keep up the good work, Andre!\", u\"I don't know why I tried this place again, it's always disappointing. I guess I wanted fried chicken and didn't want to mess up my kitchen.\\n\\nOne star because I didn't have to wait forever like last time I was here, and because the cashier was friendly.\\n\\nZero additional stars because the food was cold, they left out part of my order, and when I called to arrange a replacement on my next visit, their phone number did not appear to work. So I paid for food I didn't get, the food I got sucked, and my only option is to drive back because they don't have a phone?!\\n\\nI have low expectations for fast food, but this location never fails to disappoint.\", u\"On the one side, this is a KFC.  It's expensive for fast food, and for gosh sakes, it's chicken.\\n\\nTHAT SAID, the manager, Andre, is superb.   We encountered a small problem with our order, and Andre went truly out of his way to ask how -we- wanted to resolve it, gave us several options, and really went above and beyond in his final resolution. All with a real smile, and none of the usual BS one encounters at fast food joints.\\n\\nFood is what it is.  It's a KFC.  But you don't get this kind of service outside of a Four Seasons -- and perhaps not even there.  Kudos, Andre!\", u\"Got 4-piece chicken drive thru. Guy on window was nice. Unfortunately, two of the four pieces of chicken were dry. The fourth was tiny, not much meat on it. Last time I got hush puppies I got about 12 of them. This time, they gave me six inside the box. Also didn't give me butter for my biscuit.\", u\"Fucking dump. First off, my food was good, not pissed about that... BUT 30mins after i left i had fraudulent charges made to my account for the some of 500+ dollars at some shit hole location I've never been to. bitch there took my card into the back (uh, why?) prolly to skim the barcode and steal my identity. Thanks dicks. its cool, I canceled that card and now have to wait 5 fucking business days for a new one. All over some fucking shitty chicken. Fuck y'all.\", u\"Stay away. KFC food is ok. Long John's is awful. Too salty, too greasy, and miserable. I went in to eat and the sitting area was barely ok. The washroom was disgusting.

What a mistake.\\n\\nFirst off, in general KFC's fried chicken is just okay. However, if you get pieces that are not freshly made, they are no better than microwave fried chicken from the frozen foods section. Secondly, all the side dishes were starches - french fries, mashed potato, corn, biscuits and gravy. Lastly, the food wasn't cheap.\\n\\nIn the future, if I want this stuff, I should just purchase a Hungryman TV dinner and nuke that at home.\", u'I am a long time Long John Silvers fan from way back in the mid 80\\'s, when there was just one in the whole bay area, in El Sobrante or Pinole. We used to drive all the way up from San Jose just to soak in the dark planked ambience. We enjoyed running our fingers along the real pirate ship rope intended to keep people in line (although when we went, there were never more than one person in front of us) .\\n\\nBest of all, the food. And we loved how the secret handshake of \"umm...extra crumblies, please!\" led to a pile of extra crunchy dough bits sprinkled over our entire monochromatic meal. Crumblies were the product of extra batter broken off during frying, and then saved with a spatula as an efficient retrieval and delivery mechanism.\\n\\nNow, with an Long John Silver\\'s only a mere 1.5 miles away from home, I could hardly wait. The first thing I noticed was the distinct lack of real pirate ship wreckage. Instead, the place looked like a McDonald Playland inside. It was pleasant enough, but I liked the old dark wood old school steakhouse-like atmosphere. Granted this is being shared with a KFC, and the Colonel and Long John probably had it out and the Colonel won. OK, well, the food is really the draw anyhow.\\n\\nThe menu seemed a little more complicated than I remembered. I ended up ordering the \"L3\". Sounds mouthwatering, right? This consisted of 1 chicken plank, 1 fish, french fries, a frugal dousing of crumblies, and a diet coke. All for only $5.99. I began by adding about 8 packages of malt vinegar. Such memories! The pungent aroma went straight up my nose with a cocaine rush. Unfortunately, the food was a mere shadow of itself 20 year ago. A step up from Mrs Paul\\'s certainly, but really an overly salty highly battered mess of a meal whose nutritional value could only be associated with simple hydrocarbons. The diet coke was pretty good though', u\"My 1-star is a lie.  This place is a -5 for sure.  We ordered the special we'd seen on tv from LJS along with a bunch of other crap just out of curiosity, and it was basically all inedible, save for the mashed potatoes and gravy, but those were, of course, from KFC and they're perpetually un-messupable (sure, it's a word.  Well...I mean, now it is).  \\n\\nThe fish was soggy and tough, and the breading was a freaking nightmare.  I would have preferred fishsticks to the chewy, pseudo marine life abomination I had to power through. The chicken?  Frightening and so un-KFC-like.  So scared was I, that every single piece of it went into the garbage uneaten after one tentative bite.  And the hush puppies, the thing I harbored the most hope for since eating them once as a child and remembering them fondly, were abysmally dry, tasteless, and yech.  \\n\\nI managed to choke down one piece of fish that, were it still alive, and if it had really been fish, would have probably thought I was trying to push it back into a cloudy sea of malt vinegar and tartar sauce.  My saucy, makeshift ocean was the only way I was going to get any food in my stomach.  In a last-ditch effort to save my beloved hush puppies, I whipped up fresh honey butter for dipping and then concluded there was just no way to make them palatable.  All in all, it was $30 that went straight into the trash.\", u\"Kfc's portions are pretty small, but service is perfect\", u'I got the 7 piece Value bucket at KFC today, to go.\\n\\nI ate 2 pieces.\\n\\nI have 4 more pieces in the bucket.\\n\\nWTF?', u\"Sad that this place has such bad reviews.  Have I really been lucky the past few times I've swung by?  Service has been awesome--fast and friendly.  They're pretty good about making substitutions if you ask for them--once I didn't want 5 biscuits so they gave me some corn on the cob instead.  The chicken they give me is always piping hot and crisp--not sure what else a gal could ask for.  Docking one star because sometimes the seasoning is a tad on the salty on the Long John Silver stuff as well as the chicken.\", u'Its fast food-its kfc. The only difference is they no longer use the secret receipe. One can taste frozen -like hungary mans and see it tatse the same. Having said that. It is good fast food and ALL the employees are friendly. A few like the manager and a few cashiers are very nice and socialable.\\n---------\\nWow-- impressive even after not eatting there for over a month the employees still remember my name  UNLIKE many places... I would give an ADDITIONAL five stars if I could...', u'9 pm, dining room thrashed. Did like the bulletin board with all the Golden State Warriors stuff on it. On 2nd visit, they had no problem giving me cold soggy fries, but also had no problem replacing them.', u\"We go here because of the nostalgia Long John Silvers brings for my Hubsters. He grew up in Texas with LJS and its hard to find out here in California. I always end up munching on the crispy fried chicken and a side of cole slaw. Staff could use a bit more training but overall the food is decent and tastes like what you'd expect from KFC.\", u'The MEAT MONSTER, aka Double Down Burger, is fast food in its most honest, undisguised form. Salads and wraps? HELL NO! We\\'re giving you meat with meat, cheese and bacon (otherwise known as the best parts of the sandwich).\\n\\nAnd I think it\\'ll feed a family of four if you\\'re not used to eating pure salt and grease.\\n\\nThe girl kinda smirked when she heard what we wanted, and then asked us if we wanted it fried or grilled. We just looked at her like, \"WTF, grilled? You think we came here to get this thing grilled?\"\\n\\nAnyways, I\\'ll probably die sooner for having eaten this thing, but I\\'m pretty freaking satisfied. Would have it with a beer any day, and most likely throw it up within the hour. WIN WIN', u\"Expensive & Horrible\\n\\nThere used to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken across the street, and this is the new store.  I was going to Orchard Supply Hardware yesterday, and it being lunch time decided to try this new location.\\n\\nI pulled into the drivethrough lane, and ordered the sampler plate - which did not come with a drink.  I asked for corn instead of fries and a Root Beer.\\n\\nThe total was over $10.  That's OK, I knew the cost and was just trying out the new stuff, because it is also a Long John Silvers as well which is new and I have never tried.\\n\\nI paid, got my food, and then noticed that I had no corn.  I had to drive back around to give back the cole slaw and get my corn.  Very irritating, but it does happen at drivethroughs sometimes.\\n\\nI ate lunch in the OSH parking lot, and I could not believe how little and what poor quality I got for my money.\\n\\nMost of the box was filled with fried breading flakes.  There were some shrimp but mostly blobs of breading that were maybe trying to be shrimp or something, but I could not tell which was which, and the few shrimps that I got were all when I examined them by removing the breading just slightly larger larger than a grain or two of rice.\\n\\nThen there were 2 larger shrimp, slightly larger but not much.  Very greasy and salty not much flavor.\\n\\nI got two giant fried balls of what looked like bread?  Have no idea what those were, but they were about the largest things in the box.\\n\\nI got a piece of fish which was encrusted with fried crust and a fried chicken chunk.  These were the only two edible portions and not bad, but they were not worth over $10.\\n\\nThis was a try-out for me and a very negative experience.  Even had everything been cooked perfectly, I would not want to go back there.  I felt they were careless, a rip-off, used cheap ingredients and a very crummy place.  The attitude and professionalism of the order taker and the cashier were not good either.\\n\\nThey did seem to know how to speak English though, which is rare for a fast food place in this area.\", u\"I have no desire to ever come back here.  I thought I would be okay with the food, but for what I paid I was highly disappointed.  The corn tasted like it had been sitting in the vat of water for over 2 hours, the chicken was lacking in portion size, and the biscuit was moist.  To add insult to injury, they didn't give me a fork when I went through the drive-thru.  Please explain to me how I am supposed to eat coleslaw without a fork.\\n\\nMy suggestion is if you're hungry, just keep driving right on by.  There are other places close by that are better than here by any means.\", u\"By far one of the worse customer service fast food places ive ever been to in my life time. It took 15 mins from when I ordered a 3 piece chicken dinner to get it and there was one person in line ahead of me wating for along time as well!! She asked the cash register attedant in disgust how much longer. I've been to this KFC about 10 times now and 8 of the 10 has been a poor response with customer service. Please someone fix the customer service part of this business because one word will describe it SHIT...........\", u\"It's KFC like any other KFC. But my late night order is a nightmare. They don't have enough chicken left and will just gave you whatever leftover. And it's not FAST, it took forever to get your food.\", u\"Live in Mtn View, so have been through the drive-through to get some chicken for the kids many times.  I noticed the Manager, Andre, who is aways awesome and helpful, has been managing the drive-through windows now every time I'm there.  It looks like he took the review below seriously and wants to make sure it doesn't happen again.  I know his name because he always greets everyone over the ordering speaker with a great, fun welcome and introduces himself.\\n\\nChicken is aways good.  Building is beautiful.  Andre always has a smile and is extremely courteous.  For a fast-food chain, I love coming here.  Two this up!  And keep up the good work, Andre!\", u\"I don't know why I tried this place again, it's always disappointing. I guess I wanted fried chicken and didn't want to mess up my kitchen.\\n\\nOne star because I didn't have to wait forever like last time I was here, and because the cashier was friendly.\\n\\nZero additional stars because the food was cold, they left out part of my order, and when I called to arrange a replacement on my next visit, their phone number did not appear to work. So I paid for food I didn't get, the food I got sucked, and my only option is to drive back because they don't have a phone?!\\n\\nI have low expectations for fast food, but this location never fails to disappoint.\", u\"On the one side, this is a KFC.  It's expensive for fast food, and for gosh sakes, it's chicken.\\n\\nTHAT SAID, the manager, Andre, is superb.   We encountered a small problem with our order, and Andre went truly out of his way to ask how -we- wanted to resolve it, gave us several options, and really went above and beyond in his final resolution. All with a real smile, and none of the usual BS one encounters at fast food joints.\\n\\nFood is what it is.  It's a KFC.  But you don't get this kind of service outside of a Four Seasons -- and perhaps not even there.  Kudos, Andre!\", u\"Got 4-piece chicken drive thru. Guy on window was nice. Unfortunately, two of the four pieces of chicken were dry. The fourth was tiny, not much meat on it. Last time I got hush puppies I got about 12 of them. This time, they gave me six inside the box. Also didn't give me butter for my biscuit.\", u\"Fucking dump. First off, my food was good, not pissed about that... BUT 30mins after i left i had fraudulent charges made to my account for the some of 500+ dollars at some shit hole location I've never been to. bitch there took my card into the back (uh, why?) prolly to skim the barcode and steal my identity. Thanks dicks. its cool, I canceled that card and now have to wait 5 fucking business days for a new one. All over some fucking shitty chicken. Fuck y'all.\", u\"Stay away. KFC food is ok. Long John's is awful. Too salty, too greasy, and miserable. I went in to eat and the sitting area was barely ok. The washroom was disgusting. Threw my meal in the trash and walked out.\\n\\nI'll still order KFC drive thru, but not coming near a Long John's. Too bad.\", u'Rectified a mistake so I cannot complain. Drive threw is hit or miss. Call ahead and they will have it ready.', u\"I'm not a fan of the combination of KFC and Long John's under the same roof as don't like fish prep mixed with my chicken but they seem to do a good job with it.  They're normally quick, friendly, and the food is hot which fulfills the basic expectations of fast food.  We come by here now and then because they do a good job.\", u'My review happened just today... We  went to the drive thru, i ordered 12 pc family meal with 3 sides (mac and cheese, mashed potato and sweet corn kernel) and an extra large gravy plus chicken pot pie. When i paid on the nxt window i waited a couple minutes.. Guy came back, no chicken pot pie.. I said its fine i just want refund... When we get home, i got 12 chix of course BUT NO extra gravy when i paid for it... And my sides, 2 mashed potato and corn, NO lac and cheese... GOsh so disappointing!!! What a sunday!!! Cnt go back bcoz we are home already!!!! Charging me for extra gravy and its not there.', u\"GUILTY AS CHARGED, yes I eat KFC, quite often actually  I just didn't ck-in on Yelp until recently LOL :). ... it's my go-to place to satisfy my fried-chicken cravingsdue to the proximity, the price, the no fuss no frill, yay!\\n\\nThe service here is usually quite stellar. Once they made me wait for like 20 minutes for white meat (breast) and green beans and they gave me a FREE cake to compensate me waiting! Thanks yo!!! Another time, they did not have white meat and they gave me extra chicken with no charge, sweeettttt!!!\\n\\nThe workers, especially the chubby guy is very kind and friendly (both time, he was the one who gave me free stuff LOL!).\\n\\nI don't like their new chicken bites.. too much dough and too salty.. I usually get the original here.. O and it's great that it's a joint franchise with Long John Silver so you can get your seafood fix at the same time ahahaha. Although, I had their salmon dish once and the fish was so overcooked and dry..also the snapper fish and chips had too much dough, no bueno!\", u'I will never set foot in this place again. Period.\\n\\nFive years ago I decided to \"go fish\" late one morning. I\\'m almost positive the fish I got was merely one warmed from the previous night. It tasted dry and very soggy. About two hours later I was projectile vomiting on the job site.  \\n\\nTurns out I got food poisoning and spent a few nights in the hospital.\\n\\nToday unfortunately I decided to give this place another whirl. I decided to order KFC this time and I went at lunch to avoid a possible re-warming attempt.\\n\\nI ordered a famous bowl and waited 20 minutes, nothing came. When I noticed everyone after me had their food, I flipped. I demanded my food immediately or a full refund. They said they didn\\'t know where my food was.\\n\\nThe manager did give me a full refund and apologized.  However this place is shit.', u\"I don't care what anyone says, I love long John's!  They have the best chicken planks period,  their fish is better then a lot of fish and chip places. Dont get me wrong, I have had bad food at long johns, but It is rare. Growing up in Texas, we always ate here. It was my favorite as a kid. I'm so happy that they are now in the bay area. I used to drive from san mateo out to tracy just to eat it. Oh yes I did!\", u'I went there yesterday. Had a coupon for 50c wings. I wanted 8 of them. First thing I got from the girl in counter was we do not have a set of 8. When I tried to explain her as per coupon it is per wing, she reluctantly added a 5 set combo and 3 set combo and then reduced something else from there. When I asked for grilled wings, the answer was pretty quick with a weird face \" We don\\'t carry that\" (you suckkaaaa).. She also over charged me but by now the least I can bother and just got the hell out of there.. not coming back to this one!', u'Worst service ever!

We enjoyed running our fingers along the real pirate ship rope intended to keep people in line (although when we went, there were never more than one person in front of us) .\\n\\nBest of all, the food. And we loved how the secret handshake of \"umm...extra crumblies, please!\" led to a pile of extra crunchy dough bits sprinkled over our entire monochromatic meal. Crumblies were the product of extra batter broken off during frying, and then saved with a spatula as an efficient retrieval and delivery mechanism.\\n\\nNow, with an Long John Silver\\'s only a mere 1.5 miles away from home, I could hardly wait. The first thing I noticed was the distinct lack of real pirate ship wreckage. Instead, the place looked like a McDonald Playland inside. It was pleasant enough, but I liked the old dark wood old school steakhouse-like atmosphere. Granted this is being shared with a KFC, and the Colonel and Long John probably had it out and the Colonel won. OK, well, the food is really the draw anyhow.\\n\\nThe menu seemed a little more complicated than I remembered. I ended up ordering the \"L3\". Sounds mouthwatering, right? This consisted of 1 chicken plank, 1 fish, french fries, a frugal dousing of crumblies, and a diet coke. All for only $5.99. I began by adding about 8 packages of malt vinegar. Such memories! The pungent aroma went straight up my nose with a cocaine rush. Unfortunately, the food was a mere shadow of itself 20 year ago. A step up from Mrs Paul\\'s certainly, but really an overly salty highly battered mess of a meal whose nutritional value could only be associated with simple hydrocarbons. The diet coke was pretty good though', u\"My 1-star is a lie.  This place is a -5 for sure.  We ordered the special we'd seen on tv from LJS along with a bunch of other crap just out of curiosity, and it was basically all inedible, save for the mashed potatoes and gravy, but those were, of course, from KFC and they're perpetually un-messupable (sure, it's a word.  Well...I mean, now it is).  \\n\\nThe fish was soggy and tough, and the breading was a freaking nightmare.  I would have preferred fishsticks to the chewy, pseudo marine life abomination I had to power through. The chicken?  Frightening and so un-KFC-like.  So scared was I, that every single piece of it went into the garbage uneaten after one tentative bite.  And the hush puppies, the thing I harbored the most hope for since eating them once as a child and remembering them fondly, were abysmally dry, tasteless, and yech.  \\n\\nI managed to choke down one piece of fish that, were it still alive, and if it had really been fish, would have probably thought I was trying to push it back into a cloudy sea of malt vinegar and tartar sauce.  My saucy, makeshift ocean was the only way I was going to get any food in my stomach.  In a last-ditch effort to save my beloved hush puppies, I whipped up fresh honey butter for dipping and then concluded there was just no way to make them palatable.  All in all, it was $30 that went straight into the trash.\", u\"Kfc's portions are pretty small, but service is perfect\", u'I got the 7 piece Value bucket at KFC today, to go.\\n\\nI ate 2 pieces.\\n\\nI have 4 more pieces in the bucket.\\n\\nWTF?', u\"Sad that this place has such bad reviews.  Have I really been lucky the past few times I've swung by?  Service has been awesome--fast and friendly.  They're pretty good about making substitutions if you ask for them--once I didn't want 5 biscuits so they gave me some corn on the cob instead.  The chicken they give me is always piping hot and crisp--not sure what else a gal could ask for.  Docking one star because sometimes the seasoning is a tad on the salty on the Long John Silver stuff as well as the chicken.\", u'Its fast food-its kfc. The only difference is they no longer use the secret receipe. One can taste frozen -like hungary mans and see it tatse the same. Having said that. It is good fast food and ALL the employees are friendly. A few like the manager and a few cashiers are very nice and socialable.\\n---------\\nWow-- impressive even after not eatting there for over a month the employees still remember my name  UNLIKE many places... I would give an ADDITIONAL five stars if I could...', u'9 pm, dining room thrashed. Did like the bulletin board with all the Golden State Warriors stuff on it. On 2nd visit, they had no problem giving me cold soggy fries, but also had no problem replacing them.', u\"We go here because of the nostalgia Long John Silvers brings for my Hubsters. He grew up in Texas with LJS and its hard to find out here in California. I always end up munching on the crispy fried chicken and a side of cole slaw. Staff could use a bit more training but overall the food is decent and tastes like what you'd expect from KFC.\", u'The MEAT MONSTER, aka Double Down Burger, is fast food in its most honest, undisguised form. Salads and wraps? HELL NO! We\\'re giving you meat with meat, cheese and bacon (otherwise known as the best parts of the sandwich).\\n\\nAnd I think it\\'ll feed a family of four if you\\'re not used to eating pure salt and grease.\\n\\nThe girl kinda smirked when she heard what we wanted, and then asked us if we wanted it fried or grilled. We just looked at her like, \"WTF, grilled? You think we came here to get this thing grilled?\"\\n\\nAnyways, I\\'ll probably die sooner for having eaten this thing, but I\\'m pretty freaking satisfied. Would have it with a beer any day, and most likely throw it up within the hour. WIN WIN', u\"Expensive & Horrible\\n\\nThere used to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken across the street, and this is the new store.  I was going to Orchard Supply Hardware yesterday, and it being lunch time decided to try this new location.\\n\\nI pulled into the drivethrough lane, and ordered the sampler plate - which did not come with a drink.  I asked for corn instead of fries and a Root Beer.\\n\\nThe total was over $10.  That's OK, I knew the cost and was just trying out the new stuff, because it is also a Long John Silvers as well which is new and I have never tried.\\n\\nI paid, got my food, and then noticed that I had no corn.  I had to drive back around to give back the cole slaw and get my corn.  Very irritating, but it does happen at drivethroughs sometimes.\\n\\nI ate lunch in the OSH parking lot, and I could not believe how little and what poor quality I got for my money.\\n\\nMost of the box was filled with fried breading flakes.  There were some shrimp but mostly blobs of breading that were maybe trying to be shrimp or something, but I could not tell which was which, and the few shrimps that I got were all when I examined them by removing the breading just slightly larger larger than a grain or two of rice.\\n\\nThen there were 2 larger shrimp, slightly larger but not much.  Very greasy and salty not much flavor.\\n\\nI got two giant fried balls of what looked like bread?  Have no idea what those were, but they were about the largest things in the box.\\n\\nI got a piece of fish which was encrusted with fried crust and a fried chicken chunk.  These were the only two edible portions and not bad, but they were not worth over $10.\\n\\nThis was a try-out for me and a very negative experience.  Even had everything been cooked perfectly, I would not want to go back there.  I felt they were careless, a rip-off, used cheap ingredients and a very crummy place.  The attitude and professionalism of the order taker and the cashier were not good either.\\n\\nThey did seem to know how to speak English though, which is rare for a fast food place in this area.\", u\"I have no desire to ever come back here.  I thought I would be okay with the food, but for what I paid I was highly disappointed.  The corn tasted like it had been sitting in the vat of water for over 2 hours, the chicken was lacking in portion size, and the biscuit was moist.  To add insult to injury, they didn't give me a fork when I went through the drive-thru.  Please explain to me how I am supposed to eat coleslaw without a fork.\\n\\nMy suggestion is if you're hungry, just keep driving right on by.  There are other places close by that are better than here by any means.\", u\"By far one of the worse customer service fast food places ive ever been to in my life time. It took 15 mins from when I ordered a 3 piece chicken dinner to get it and there was one person in line ahead of me wating for along time as well!! She asked the cash register attedant in disgust how much longer. I've been to this KFC about 10 times now and 8 of the 10 has been a poor response with customer service. Please someone fix the customer service part of this business because one word will describe it SHIT...........\", u\"It's KFC like any other KFC. But my late night order is a nightmare. They don't have enough chicken left and will just gave you whatever leftover. And it's not FAST, it took forever to get your food.\"]"

    "FIELD4":"[u\"So I went here a year ago and I still think about my meal.  For me, I write a lot of nice things about most food that just basically tastes good or is clever or I like.  I am a simple foodie, its very clear to me bad food is bad, good food is good.  But then......there is a place like this where I thought I knew what flavor was, where I thought I'd eaten good food......and then you know with the first bite you are in a different stratosphere of elegant and cultured food.\\n\\nFirst of all, as a vegetarian I did struggle here. There was nothing on the menu I wanted to eat (because I am ONE OF THOSE vegetarians - the picky one who doesn't like eggplant, spinach or mushrooms......sigh. Life would be so much easier if I did).  So the actual one vegetarian item on the menu I couldn't eat that night.\\n\\nHowever, I explained my situation to the server and she worked with the chef to give me an extra large plate of vegetables that pretty much blew my mind.  The subtle flavors, the herbs, the delicacy of effort was totally amazing.  I have never eaten a meal that perfect that made me feel like I was on one of those food shows or something.\\n\\nMaybe I don't get out enough too.  However, I do really hop around a lot of local restaurants and have tried many things both in the US and abroad, and this meal was truly special.  I think about it a lot, and though I haven't had an opportunity to return yet I am going to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my meal when I do and that is a wonderful palate pleasing heart feeling.\\n\\nSince I was just thinking about the meal again today, and happened to be on Yelp to write (finally, thanks to a sleeping baby) I needed to pour out some love to this place.\", u\"How did I miss this little gem for all these years? And this was just when I thought I was bored of Mountain View's offerings. I loved EVERYTHING from the food to the ambiance to the service. I even stayed for dessert. Prices were reasonable. Dinner for two, dessert, and a couple of glasses of wine came out to around 130 bucks. I can't speak to the wine list because I ordered by the glass, which was their house Salmon Creek, I believe.\\n\\nFrom the outside, it doesn't look like much but don't let the exterior fool you. There is no music, which suited me just fine as the tables were all filled and there was a pleasant buzz of conversation so it didn't feel awkward.\\n\\nMy family usually dines at La Foret in Almaden Valley so I'll definitely recommend they try this place and you should too!\", u\"This spot has been on our favorites list for a long time.  Jean Michelle has been serving great, traditional French Cuisine for years.  Love the Lobster Bisque and the Duck, no wait, the Rack of lamb... or the Filet.  The Coquille...  \\nMasterful simplicity...\\nEvery time I'm in the Bay Area we find an excuse to go there.  This brand of French  tradition has become a lost art.\", u\"Solid 3.5 stars. (Rounded up.)\\n\\nIt seems pretty rare these days to find a charming bistro that offers an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are dining in a small town in France.\\nThe restaurant is dimly lit. You will find yourself surrounded by oil paintings and books to make you feel as if you were dining in the comfort someone's home.\\n\\nGreeted as you enter in french, the service was on point and delightfully cheery. Staff was kind and attentive. (Note, we did arrive before the dinner crowd.)\\n\\nThe food was good, standard french fare executed just right. No frills, just good bistro dining. There is also a list of daily specials.\\n\\nA perk offered at this establishment is their salmon spread which provides a unique experience to the normal butter fare. It's delightful! Bread comes out warm. They are very generous in offering seconds before the need to ask.\\n\\nOver all, it's a hidden gem nestled in on El Camino Real.\\n\\nWhat you need to know:\\n\\n- Parking is around the back in the same lot with Danish Concepts\\n- Complimentary bread and salmon spread\\n- Most of the staff speaks french\\n- You may ask for your soup to be split\", u'This is a great place with some authentic french food and friendly staff. Pretty good selection of wines. Had the French onion soup and the entr\\xe9e of Portobello mushrooms in a puff pastry. Chocolat mousse for dessert was excellent too.\\nGreat for dates and small groups.', u\"I really, really really want to love Le Petit Bistro, it has all the potential to be a 5 star restaurant but fell ever so short.\\n\\nThe 5 stars could have been earned on the food alone. Which I mean, is why you go to a restaurant anyway, right? Everything my boyfriend, brother and I ate was excellent.\\n\\nFor starters my brother chose the French onion soup - classically made with the distinct tastes that make you feel at home, the boyfriend went with lobster bisque - creamy and delicious, and I opted for the duck pate - equally creamy and delicious.\\n\\nFor the main course I went with the filet mignon, served in a cognac and green peppercorn sauce, the dish was exceptional. While I requested the meat to be cooked to medium it was quite red (not pink, red) for my liking however it had the taste and consistency of melted butter, so no complaints there!\\n\\nWhere the restaurant fell short was in the service and the atmosphere. Extremely small and what could be very cozy ended up feeling tight and wedged in as more and more dinner guests arrived. By small I literally mean there were under 20 tables, maybe even under 15. And with all tables seated the wait staff was visibly struggling to keep up. I almost felt bad for how many times I requested water but I felt less and less bad as time went on and that request was ignored repeatedly.\\n\\nAgain since the restaurant was quite small the setting felt like it should be intimate however with no music playing there was an awkward hushed din across the restaurant, making it difficult to really hold a conversation. Pump in some classical French music, et voil\\xe0 - you would have a perfectly romantic setting.\\n\\nI felt Le Petit Bistro was fairly priced for their offerings, while on the slightly pricier side I wouldn't expect much less from a high quality French fare restaurant.\", u\"Their dishes taste like home-made food, with the same positive energy as you feel when eating your mom's cooking! The water they brought us was flavored with oranges as opposed to limes; this gave a very pleasant taste to water. So pleasant that I couldn't stop drinking water ;)\\nThe staff were very friendly too. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.\", u\"Update 6 years later, we are still fans of Le Petit Bistro,  the food is consistently delicious with great service.  It continues to be one of our go-to spots when we are looking for a nice meal without breaking the bank. Aside from the fact that is a great little restuarant,   the owner, Jean-Michel Peuvrelle  is a truly nice person, one Valentine's Day a few years ago, we had to cancel the day before because I had developed a bad cold.  We offered to pick it up as a  to-go order as I knew they were planning a special menu and probably had already purchased the food.  He said that was not necessary, and told my husband to come by to pick up some chicken stock for my cold, free of charge. Could not believe it, fans for life.\", u\"We had a truly enjoyable meal at Le Petit Bistro.  It was our first visit and I decided to drop by for a special occasion. While I had reservations at a Michelin star (All Spice for those curious), I was in the mood for something intimate, classic, and casual and Le Petit Bistro fit the bill perfectly.\\n\\nLocated off the busy El Camino Real, Le Petit Bistro is a long time institution to the area and the type of warm, friendly bistro I'd expect while visiting Carmel or Monterey.  The dining room is quiet and cozy but well staffed with a ma\\xeetre-d, a friendly hostess, servers and busboys.\\n\\nThe dimly lit restaurant is a nice oasis from the busy Bay Area and where others focus on an older and dated interior, we found a warm and inviting one.\\n\\nDaily specials are shared on an iPad (how's that for modern) but the menus contain all the classic French dishes you see often but rarely see executed well.  It may not be innovative or creative, but those looking for that should have known to go elsewhere.  We love classic French food so we were in for a treat. They start you out with a warm sliced baguette and ours was served with a delicious salmon mousse.  Yum!  Our order:\\n\\nFrench Onion Soup - $8.  The all time classic and done quite well here.  It was a special and has a perfect ratio of cheese to bread to broth.  Served piping hot, it was savory and warming. While many versions are super sized or too salty or filled with excessive cheese or bread (nearby Joannie's), this bowl is a testament to restraint and skill.  \\n\\nLobster Bisque - $10.  A mainstay of the menu, the lobster bisque is great as well. We found several chunks of lobster tail and a creamy and rich broth. It's well balanced and tasty.\\n\\nEscargots De Bourgogne -$10.  We haven't had escargot in awhile and locally the last time was probably the excellent Bistro Moulin in Monterey.  The ones here were fresh, drenched in butter and garlic and so aromatic.  Fun to eat though we had a Pretty Woman moment as one shell slipped away due to our clumsiness.\\n\\nCoq Au Vin De Chanturge - $18 Another mainstay of their menu and executed very well.  Super tender chicken marinated with wine and with shallots, bacon and mushrooms.  The accompanying vegetables, mashed potatoes, and carrots are old school but fresh and delicious.\\n\\nFilet De Boef Au Pouive De Madagascar - $31. I rarely order filet mignon as I prefer the flavorful ribeye over the more tender filet.  Nonetheless, I had heard several raves and I'm glad I listened.  The key is the wonderful peppercorn sauce but just as important is the perfect medium rare preparation.  So tender, so flavorful.  I wiped off every last drop of the sauce and finished all my mashed potatoes.\\n\\nOverall, we left both full and happy.  The hostess (wife of the owner) was friendly and engaging throughout and even shared both a wine toast for the restaurant's 25th anniversary and our special occasion as well as an after dinner glass of port though we had skipped desserts to order at our next stop - a thoughtful and nice touch.\\n\\nWhen a restaurant has been around for 25 years, they clearly are doing something right, especially in light of other places turning over frequently.  Special thanks to Local S. for providing a thoughtful review when I was researching whether to dine here. It was the right choice!\\n\\nLe Petit Bistro accepts credit cards including American Express.\", u'Great food! Great service!\\n\\nLooking forward to more visits when here from Tennessee!!', u\"Small, dimly-lit French restaurant with an intimate atmosphere. It's REALLY quiet in here, almost to the point where you feel a little awkward talking at a normal level...\\n\\nParking:\\nPrivate parking lot located in the back of the restaurant or street parking.\\n\\nService:\\nOur server wasn't particularly friendly, however, the bus service was attentive.\\n\\nFood:\\n- Lobster bisque - Lobster reduction with lobster pieces. We saw many other people in the restaurant ordering this, so we thought it would be good. We were wrong. It was nothing special. The soup was a little spicy, and there weren't very many lobster pieces in the bisque.\\n- Filet of Sole with Vegetables and Rice - One of the specials for the night (presented on an iPad). They gave a large portion of fish, which was soft, but the sauce didn't really stand out. Vegetables included some cucumber slivers, carrots, green beans, and squash. There was an incredibly small amount of rice on my plate.\\n- Tarte Tatin - Caramelized apple pie with whipped cream. This was not good at all. It did not come out warm and tasted like they got it out of a box from the market's freezer aisle. For $7.00 this was not worth it at all!\\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't return here. Prices are steep for the food you receive, and the menu, in general, is pretty limited. Also, the food lacked in quality. This is not what I would have expected from a $$$ French restaurant.\", u\"Delicious, simple French food without the pretentious French attitude! Usually I'd associate a French restaurant with $$$$, reservations required and waiters turning their noses up at you because you didn't care for the single course consisting of a sole hunk of bleu cheese, but Le Petit Bistro has none of that. The food is not overly complicated, but beautifully executed and ever so tasty. Most of their entrees are simple dishes like Coq au Vin, almond crusted salmon, lamb chops, or a filet mignon. On a recent visit, I had the almond crusted salmon and the almonds gave the fish a really great texture. Served with a simple side of stemmed veggies and mashed potatoes and I really felt like I was dining in someone's cozy little French home.\\n\\nOther dishes I've tried that I really liked are the scallops, sweet bread, and lamb chops. Their menu is pretty small, although they have daily specials on a chalkboard (or displayed on an iPad brought to your table). I will say that the one thing I truly look forward to eating is the Duck Pate, which was the closest to foie gras you could get during the Foie Gras Prohibition Era. It's definitely no foie; it's still got a liver-y ofal-ness to it, but I love it and I request extra bread to spread it onto and devour.\\n\\nI've only had the chocolate mousse for dessert, but it's very decadent and is almost like a dark chocolate mousse. Not powerfully sweet.\\n\\nReservations usually not required unless it's Valentine's Weekend. On the Friday afteroon before Valentine's, I was able to secure a table for 8:00pm although I did see a few walk-in's at the same time. Otherwise, this place is never super packed, but there are definitely regulars and lots of fans at this place. Bon Appetit!\", u\"I don't come here that often, but I find something new & tasty every time I come here.\", u\"Le petit bistro is a classy, cozy French restaurant that is easy to miss on El Camino Real.  I will not call it a hidden gem, but it is good food at a value price.  \\nWe started with the snails - VERY good - must try, very tender and perfect texture&flavor\\nLobster Tartare - minced lobster in a puff pastry, tasty complexion and good choice\\nLobster Bisque - I do not recommend, I personally didn't like it (not very unique flavors, couldn't taste the lobster)\\n\\nEntrees - rib eye steak (special) - portions are slightly large, they gave me about a 16 oz. steak, huge transition from the miniature appetizers; however the steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the mushroom sauce was nice\\nLamb chops - a little too chewy, good portions, overall a pretty good dish\\n\\nDessert - only tried the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e, which as expected was delicious, good burnt sugar top.\\n\\nService - 4 star, the only flaw was that the food came out a little slow, the meal took about 2 hours, but the waiters were patient and kind.\\n\\nOverall, Le Petit Bistro is a nice little French place with good food, worth stopping by, but not worth going out of your way to try.\", u'Excellent restaurant. The service is good, the food is delicious. I came with a few friends and everyone enjoyed the food. One of the best French restaurants in the Bay! I recommend!!', u'Exactly what a bistro should be - do a few things, but do them right. Everything we had - Lobster Bisque, Duck Liver Pate (a kind of liver not yet outlawed in California), Lamb Chops, Pork Medaillons, and Roasted Duck - were excellent. All of these are simple dishes; but it is a simple ones which are most difficult, since you cannot cover up mistakes by clever presentation or heavy sauce. I did have a small disagreement with Jean-Michel about which books should be on display - I tried to convince him to add \"Asterix\" to otherwise distinguished company of La Fontaine fables, and he even made a verbal agreement to do so (we did not shake on it, or took a blood oath, so I can\\'t blame him if he does not). Also, the waitress brought my son \"port\" instead of \"fork\" - not exactly a disagreeable mistake, easily corrected by explicitly asking for \"fourchette\"\\n\\nAs for prices - quite commensurate with the quality, so was a happy meal altogether', u\"Standard fare with good execution and a nice atmosphere. This is not somewhere you go for some newfangled creative fusion cuisine, but rather if you want some classic fresh bistro dishes prepared well. We had the duck, lamb, and pork with the pork probably being my favorite, though this is not to say I didn't like the other dishes either.\", u'Private and quiet atmosphere, make you feel home. Service is wonderful and warm. The roasted duck is amazing, crispy outside while tender inside. Lobster appetizer is also out of expectation', u\"As the name of the establishment suggests, this place is a very small bistro.  From the outside, this place looks like a dive but once inside, it is charming.  The menu is very limited and doesn't seem to change.  I'm a big fan of their pate and mussels appetizers.  I don't care for escargot but people I dined with really enjoyed it.  My favorite entr\\xe9e is the duck which is cooked two ways.  It is served with a sauce that is slightly sweet and delicious.  I recently tried the lamb chops which I didn't care for too much.  It seemed to be lightly breaded and fried.  Their desserts are good.  Overall their portions are generous and reasonably priced.\\n\\nWhen the place isn't busy, the service is good.  But as soon as it gets busy, service degrades very quickly.  When I feel like having some duck, this place is on my short list.\", u'Had a wonderful experience there! The lobster bisque was my favorite dish. The Demi canard was also excellent, succulent with nice blend of sweetness and savory. The selection of wines are solid. We had a large group and the service was attentive.', u\"Last night was the second time my boyfriend and I have been to Le Petit Bistro and both times we've loved it; he's from France and it's not often anything truly impresses him.\\n\\nBoth times we've gotten the lobster bisque and it's been spot on. This time we also ordered:\\n- lobster tartlette\\n- almond crusted salmon\\n- rack of lamb\\n- escargot\\n- creme brulee\\n-chocolate mousse\\n- a bottle saint emilion 2011 reverence\\n\\nThe owner, staff, and general service are impeccable and the food is delicious -- instead of fancy SF portions (read: small) you actually get a filling amount of food for pretty darn good prices. Not cheap enough to be our regular place for a weekly dinner but definitive worth going to once a month of so.\", u'The almond crusted salmon with bearnaise sauce is OMFG.  You get 3 different textures and 3 flavors, it\\'s perfection.  Most cooked salmon is usually quite firm.  However this was practically butterfish.  Wonderful.  They should just put it on their main menu.\\n\\nI also feed the lobster bisque to our baby, who says \"NNGGGHHH!!\" every time he gets a spoonful.', u'C\\'est magnifique!! What a wonderful evening we had last night at this lovely little place on El Camino.. Food and service are both absolutely 5-star and pricing is very decent!! We started off with their ognion soup and vinaigrette salad.. Excellent quality and a true French taste (I know, because I spent quite a few years traveling to Paris once every month). Our main courses were the \"coq au vin\" and filet mignon; both cooked to perfection!! We topped it all of with the amazing chocolate mousse! We are so happy to have found this lovely little place. Truly a little piece of Paris in The Valley!! Will be back soon!!', u'I had been wanting to try Le Petit Bistro for a few years now, and have driven past it for most of my lifetime. It\\'s one of those places that you barely even notice, as you drive by on El Camino, yet it\\'s been there the entire time. With such a long history, you know that it has to be good!\\n\\nAs far as service and food go, it was great! Our server was very attentive from the moment we walked in. But I would have to say that what turned me off was that the restaurant has a stench of old that I couldn\\'t get over. I don\\'t know if it\\'s in the carpet or seeped into the wood, and while it could add character to the business, it does remind you that the business has been there for a long time. Some people can get over it, others can\\'t. I would love to take my parents to try the food, but I know that they wouldn\\'t last 30 seconds in there.\\n\\nIf you\\'re one who can get past that, then...\\n*You can make a reservation\\n*If you get there too early in the evening, my reservation was at 6pm, the restaurant was empty, and there wasn\\'t enough ambient noise for my friend and I to chat in, without being shusshed\". It wasn\\'t a problem an hour later\\n*The servers use an ipad to show you the daily specials, so you don\\'t have to strain your eyes, looking across the room at the blackboard\\n\\nSo my girl friend and I ordered:\\n* Lobster tartlettes\\n* Lamb Chops\\n* Roast Duck\\n* Creme brulee\\n\\nWhile French food isn\\'t served family style, both entrees were perfect to split. Everything was well prepared, and delicious. It\\'s everything that you would expect in a French restaurant.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this place may not be calling out my name, the next time I\\'m looking for French food.', u'Great little french restaurant. Most dishes are very good. The baked scallop is excellent. Duck parfait qualities vary. Sometimes a bit undercooked. Escargot is fine. Sword fish, if they have it, is excellent as well. Always busy. Need reservation most of the times.', u\"This is my favorite restaurant I would eat out at with good friends. I live walking distance from here, comfortably quiet enough for deep conversation. Good for locals, but not sure if it's worth driving long distance here. So 5 stars are totally my point of view, and I'd be glad if you also think so.\\n\\nIt is on El Camino Real and it's confusing to find the parking lot, because the sign says Danish Concepts parking. Just get in there and you'll find parking lot inside.\\n\\nI feel very comfortable like at home here, very warm atmosphere inside. The Madame recognizes me and welcomes me in addictive French accent. The food is always good enough. It's not uncomfortably super delicious, so my stomach isn't so surprised but well satisfied.\\n\\nOverall, I feel great having food here. Not because of a single reason, but all of them together, good friends, warm atmosphere, great real conversation, comfortable food, addictive madame's voice, wine selections. Other customers look happy, too. What could be better than this? Have tasty food here with good friends to talk with, (optional alcohol) and be happy!\\n\\nThe price looks reasonable. You might receive the bill charging you more than you expect if you're like me, because you'll order dessert, another glass of wine, coffee and more, more, because of the comfort.\", u'Traditional classic French bistro dishes, well balanced flavors and very good portions.  Prices are reasonable. For appetizer, we tried the special lobster tartes in pastry shells followed with duck orange and lamb chops entrees.  All food are well prepared, we enjoyed the quiet atmosphere as well.', u\"Small place, with a lovely atmosphere and friendly service.\\n\\nThe menu has a few dishes that are French 'classics' (in my mind).  They are all done well enough, with reasonable prices and good portions, however nothing really stood out as 'amazing', but I don't think that is what it is trying to achieve.\\n\\nThese seem like French 'comfort' foods in an intimate setting.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems like a great place for locals to fulfill some French Cravings or for a casual date.\", u\"Very quaint!  This restaurant is small and has a limited menu, but has a lovely, romantic ambiance to it.  It's dimly lit and not very loud, perfect for small conversations with your significant other or companion.\\n\\nWe had the... Mousse de Foie de Canard (duck liver pate with cornichon), Medallions de Porc aux Champignons (medallions of tenderlion pork with mushroom demi-glace), and Filet De Boeuf Au Poivre De Madagascar (filet mignon with cognac and green peppercorn sauce).\\n\\nPate was nomsy!  There was a pretty, healthy portion of pate over a bed of pickled veggies, cabbage, olives, and pickles.  The different veggies complimented the pate well!  Loved the contrast in texture and taste!  It also paired well with the bread we had on the side.  That spread thing that came with the bread was also NOMSY!  I have no idea what it is though.  :c  Must ask next time I'm back!\\n\\nI wasn't too big of a fan of the pork though, a bit dry but was much more moist with the mushroom glaze it was sitting in.  The filet mignon was cooked nicely medium rare and was very, very tender.  Again, it was also sitting in a very rich, flavorful sauce making both entrees very, very rich in flavor.  The potato and veggies on the side of both entrees were all very simple, but tasty!  \\n\\nWe wanted to try the crepe special that night, but they unfortunately ran out.  We were disappointed, but they made it up and gave us a creme brulee on the house!  So nice of them!  Service was exceptional and the ladies were so, soooooo sweet and helpful!\", u\"Small quiet place. They don't have too many options. We went for a team dinner. Not exactly a fun place, but on the plus side, since it was quiet, we could have great conversations.\\n\\nThe food was good. I had the days special halibut. Very well cooked with sublime flavors.\", u\"Came here for my 9th years anniversary, it was quite an experience , all the hosts and servers are French and they all have that lovely French accent . Our server was a sweet blonde woman who was always attentive.  in fact the chef forgot about my order and we ended up not having any bread or appetizer for 24 minutes but I didn't know bc the server was so friendly and I thought that service was suppose to be slow here , well that wasn't the case, our server immediately tells us the problem and offered us complimentary desserts , 2 desserts dishes ! If that isn't great service I don't know what is\\n\\nAtmosphere  - ****dark, intimate yet cozy / interesting mix I know. The lightning is very dim and the restaurant is small , There's Van Gogh, Picasso and of course monet paintings on the wall and candle light on every table\\n\\nBasket bread - **** really good bread but I'm not surprised\\n\\nAppetizer - ***** escargot  ! Definitely my favorite part of the meal , it was hot, savory and I swear the garlic and butter literally melt within your mouth\\n\\nEntrees\\n\\nFilet mignon- ***quite flavorful but not as tender as I imagine it to be\\n\\nCrispy duck -**** I love duck! The meat was dark and flavorful, skin is quite crispy and the sauce gives and sweet and salty balance to each bite I endeavor\\n\\nDesserts\\n\\nCreme br\\xfbl\\xe9e  -***** oh my the the richness of its taste is still melting in my mouth\\n\\nCrepe- ** eh not that great, crepe was to thick and fruits is way too sour\\n\\nWine ****\\nWhy am I allergic to sulfite? My husband loves the wine\", u\"This place is pretty hard to notice, as it's located in an old building on El Camino, but don't judge the inside based on the outside. The staff is incredibly friendly and the overall decor is homey and intimate.\\n\\nI had the feuillette and the Mousse de Chocolat, and both were great. The portions are very reasonable and in an acceptable price range.\\n\\nAlso, there isn't a lot of parking in the back, so be prepared for that.\", u'Took my wife here for our anniversary. Best authentic French in the Bay Area. We ordered: lobster soup, French onion soup, duck liver, mussel, and half a duck. My favorite is the lobster soup. I would come here just to taste the lobster soup. Fair pricing for the high quality meal and service. A++', u'Great food, great service, and ambiance.   Will defiantly recommend the place and go back again.', u'We went here for our Anniversary (lots of coordination getting the parents to watch and put the kids down) so was hoping for a wonderful experience (given the reviews and recommendation from friends)\\n\\nSadly, that may have set our expectations too high...  \\n\\nTLDR: food was decent, nice ambiance, however, they missed small touches that would\\'ve bumped my review to 4 stars - things such as not even mentioning of our anniversary and and a disengaged waitress\\n\\nOur order:\\n*lobster bisque - pretty good, several pieces of lobster\\n*french onion soup - good, but not the best I\\'ve had\\n*crispy duck - portions were decent and the duck was quite tasty\\n*lamb shank - was ok, nothing to write home about\\n*mashed potatoes (side on both entrees) meh - felt like something I\\'ve had from an all you can eat kind of place\\n*grand marnier cheesecake w/ fruit & melba sauce - decent interpretation of the cheesecake and flavor.  Unfortunately, I had to eat it all since the alcohol wasn\\'t cooked off as the waitress said it was.  \\n*water only\\n\\n+\\'s:\\n*quick and easy online reservations, was able to make a comment that we were celebrating our anniversary\\n\\n*did not notice an \\'old\\' odor (in several other reviews), the yummy smells from the kitchen were noticed in the parking lot!\\n\\n*reasonable pricing from a French restaurant\\n\\n*bread was excellent (warm/recently toasted), crunch crust and soft middle.  Had enough flavor to stand on it\\'s own without needing to use the butter spread (which was also good)\\n\\n*host was nice and pleasant, was given our choice of where to sit, we chose to be near the kitchen, we kind of like sitting near the action\\n\\n*water cup never went below the 50% mark\\n\\n-\\'s\\n*no ipads for us (used to display the specials), so I had to ask a few times what the specials were (poor dad memory, what can I say)\\n\\n*waitress was so-so, sadly she seemed too busy to not really care about our table, it was almost as if we had to ask for the next step of the meal (questions about the menu, we received no recommendations on what to order, didn\\'t really seem to care to serve us).  When we got to the dessert phase - she didn\\'t know what melba sauce was when we asked and didn\\'t really know how some of the desserts were prepared (whether the alcohol was cooked off on the cheesecake, she said it was, but when we got it, the alcohol was not cooked off...).  When we asked about the melba sauce, the response was \"I don\\'t eat sugar\" didn\\'t even offer to go find out for us... so I just looked it up myself.  \\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s too much to expect from a service point of view as I\\'ve dined at similar priced restaurants and received much better service.  Might have just been an off day for that person, a different waitress took our picture seemed to have a bit more engagement and the bus staff was attentive.\\n\\n*nothing celebratory about our dining experience for our anniversary (despite me mentioning it during the reservation process, I know they do things for people celebrating since I saw another table get a dessert with a candle it it)\\n\\nBottom line, if friends wanted to go here to eat I would dine there with them, but I won\\'t be seeking this restaurant out.  I don\\'t think I\\'d bring my 2 kids here, not the right setting.  IF you are bringing kids you may want to call in advance to make sure they have enough high chairs (I only saw one, in the mens/womens shared bathroom)', u'Good escargots, not exactly how I love them but probably still the best I had over here.\\nThe coq au vin was pretty good.\\n\\nThe best feature of this restaurant, is by far its humbleness.\\nFor once french food is not over priced and not pretentious.', u\"Went to the place for a field trip. The food was not as amazing as expected from my French teacher telling us that French food is complete on a difference level than American food. Over all it was a good meal. Portions are small so order more than one entree if you usually eat a lot. I have the beef and chocolate moose for dessert. It was pretty good. If you are looking for a romantic place to bring you're girlfriend and have a different vibe. This is the place. Prices are little expensive tho\", u\"I would recommend this place to anyone in that area. I have been there twice and both times were for a business trip (I couldn't wait to go back the second time).\\n\\nI got the pork medallions both times once with the French onion soup which was amazing and once with the mussels which were also very good.\\n\\nThey also have a great local wine selection and I almost forgot to mention that even there water is good. Instead of lemon they put a tad bit of orange, barely enough to notice but it was tasty refreshing and different.\\n\\nI will be coming back anytime I'm in the area for sure.\", u'Not bad but I don\\'t think it\\'s worthy of a return visit either. Our party ordered most of the menu: for the apps, escargot, pate, lobster in phyllo shells, and a couple salads.\\nThe escargot was pretty good-- the pesto added a nice flavor to the snails. Otherwise, the apps were pretty mediocre at best. Avoid the pate, it was not very good at all.\\nThe salads consist of iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes: nothing special.\\n\\nFor the entrees, the filet and sole were probably our favorites. The filet was in a Demi glac\\xe9 that really enhanced the flavor. It came with some mashed potatoes and green beans that add some variety. The bread they provided also paired well with the sauce.\\n\\nThe fish entrees were flavorful, just not overly plenteous. The lamb chop was very large but had a little too much gamey flavor for my liking.\\n\\nThe service was all right-- they definitely take pride in their \"French\" style. So much so that when we opted for no dessert and asked for the check soon after we finished our dishes, it appeared that our server was moderately offended. They are definitely used to people coming and killing several hours along with drinking plenty of wine.', u'This is our go-to place for birthdays, celebrations, and big life events. We always get top service, and walk away comfortably full from a wonderful meal. Not sure why someone commented that the wine list is limited. It is HUGE! They also do simple cocktails, like my favorite, Kir Royale.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is dimly lit, romantic. Perfect for a couple although there are sometimes families or business dinners too.\\n\\nI have NEVER had bad food or bad service here, and have been a loyal customer for over 10 years.', u\"So I went here a year ago and I still think about my meal.  For me, I write a lot of nice things about most food that just basically tastes good or is clever or I like.  I am a simple foodie, its very clear to me bad food is bad, good food is good.  But then......there is a place like this where I thought I knew what flavor was, where I thought I'd eaten good food......and then you know with the first bite you are in a different stratosphere of elegant and cultured food.\\n\\nFirst of all, as a vegetarian I did struggle here. There was nothing on the menu I wanted to eat (because I am ONE OF THOSE vegetarians - the picky one who doesn't like eggplant, spinach or mushrooms......sigh. Life would be so much easier if I did).  So the actual one vegetarian item on the menu I couldn't eat that night.\\n\\nHowever, I explained my situation to the server and she worked with the chef to give me an extra large plate of vegetables that pretty much blew my mind.  The subtle flavors, the herbs, the delicacy of effort was totally amazing.  I have never eaten a meal that perfect that made me feel like I was on one of those food shows or something.\\n\\nMaybe I don't get out enough too.  However, I do really hop around a lot of local restaurants and have tried many things both in the US and abroad, and this meal was truly special.  I think about it a lot, and though I haven't had an opportunity to return yet I am going to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my meal when I do and that is a wonderful palate pleasing heart feeling.\\n\\nSince I was just thinking about the meal again today, and happened to be on Yelp to write (finally, thanks to a sleeping baby) I needed to pour out some love to this place.\", u\"How did I miss this little gem for all these years? And this was just when I thought I was bored of Mountain View's offerings. I loved EVERYTHING from the food to the ambiance to the service. I even stayed for dessert. Prices were reasonable. Dinner for two, dessert, and a couple of glasses of wine came out to around 130 bucks. I can't speak to the wine list because I ordered by the glass, which was their house Salmon Creek, I believe.\\n\\nFrom the outside, it doesn't look like much but don't let the exterior fool you. There is no music, which suited me just fine as the tables were all filled and there was a pleasant buzz of conversation so it didn't feel awkward.\\n\\nMy family usually dines at La Foret in Almaden Valley so I'll definitely recommend they try this place and you should too!\", u\"This spot has been on our favorites list for a long time.  Jean Michelle has been serving great, traditional French Cuisine for years.  Love the Lobster Bisque and the Duck, no wait, the Rack of lamb... or the Filet.  The Coquille...  \\nMasterful simplicity...\\nEvery time I'm in the Bay Area we find an excuse to go there.  This brand of French  tradition has become a lost art.\", u\"Solid 3.5 stars. (Rounded up.)\\n\\nIt seems pretty rare these days to find a charming bistro that offers an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are dining in a small town in France.\\nThe restaurant is dimly lit. You will find yourself surrounded by oil paintings and books to make you feel as if you were dining in the comfort someone's home.\\n\\nGreeted as you enter in french, the service was on point and delightfully cheery. Staff was kind and attentive. (Note, we did arrive before the dinner crowd.)\\n\\nThe food was good, standard french fare executed just right. No frills, just good bistro dining. There is also a list of daily specials.\\n\\nA perk offered at this establishment is their salmon spread which provides a unique experience to the normal butter fare. It's delightful! Bread comes out warm. They are very generous in offering seconds before the need to ask.\\n\\nOver all, it's a hidden gem nestled in on El Camino Real.\\n\\nWhat you need to know:\\n\\n- Parking is around the back in the same lot with Danish Concepts\\n- Complimentary bread and salmon spread\\n- Most of the staff speaks french\\n- You may ask for your soup to be split\", u'This is a great place with some authentic french food and friendly staff. Pretty good selection of wines. Had the French onion soup and the entr\\xe9e of Portobello mushrooms in a puff pastry. Chocolat mousse for dessert was excellent too.\\nGreat for dates and small groups.', u\"I really, really really want to love Le Petit Bistro, it has all the potential to be a 5 star restaurant but fell ever so short.\\n\\nThe 5 stars could have been earned on the food alone. Which I mean, is why you go to a restaurant anyway, right? Everything my boyfriend, brother and I ate was excellent.\\n\\nFor starters my brother chose the French onion soup - classically made with the distinct tastes that make you feel at home, the boyfriend went with lobster bisque - creamy and delicious, and I opted for the duck pate - equally creamy and delicious.\\n\\nFor the main course I went with the filet mignon, served in a cognac and green peppercorn sauce, the dish was exceptional. While I requested the meat to be cooked to medium it was quite red (not pink, red) for my liking however it had the taste and consistency of melted butter, so no complaints there!\\n\\nWhere the restaurant fell short was in the service and the atmosphere. Extremely small and what could be very cozy ended up feeling tight and wedged in as more and more dinner guests arrived. By small I literally mean there were under 20 tables, maybe even under 15. And with all tables seated the wait staff was visibly struggling to keep up. I almost felt bad for how many times I requested water but I felt less and less bad as time went on and that request was ignored repeatedly.\\n\\nAgain since the restaurant was quite small the setting felt like it should be intimate however with no music playing there was an awkward hushed din across the restaurant, making it difficult to really hold a conversation. Pump in some classical French music, et voil\\xe0 - you would have a perfectly romantic setting.\\n\\nI felt Le Petit Bistro was fairly priced for their offerings, while on the slightly pricier side I wouldn't expect much less from a high quality French fare restaurant.\", u\"Their dishes taste like home-made food, with the same positive energy as you feel when eating your mom's cooking! The water they brought us was flavored with oranges as opposed to limes; this gave a very pleasant taste to water. So pleasant that I couldn't stop drinking water ;)\\nThe staff were very friendly too. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.\", u\"Update 6 years later, we are still fans of Le Petit Bistro,  the food is consistently delicious with great service.  It continues to be one of our go-to spots when we are looking for a nice meal without breaking the bank. Aside from the fact that is a great little restuarant,   the owner, Jean-Michel Peuvrelle  is a truly nice person, one Valentine's Day a few years ago, we had to cancel the day before because I had developed a bad cold.  We offered to pick it up as a  to-go order as I knew they were planning a special menu and probably had already purchased the food.  He said that was not necessary, and told my husband to come by to pick up some chicken stock for my cold, free of charge. Could not believe it, fans for life.\", u\"We had a truly enjoyable meal at Le Petit Bistro.  It was our first visit and I decided to drop by for a special occasion. While I had reservations at a Michelin star (All Spice for those curious), I was in the mood for something intimate, classic, and casual and Le Petit Bistro fit the bill perfectly.\\n\\nLocated off the busy El Camino Real, Le Petit Bistro is a long time institution to the area and the type of warm, friendly bistro I'd expect while visiting Carmel or Monterey.  The dining room is quiet and cozy but well staffed with a ma\\xeetre-d, a friendly hostess, servers and busboys.\\n\\nThe dimly lit restaurant is a nice oasis from the busy Bay Area and where others focus on an older and dated interior, we found a warm and inviting one.\\n\\nDaily specials are shared on an iPad (how's that for modern) but the menus contain all the classic French dishes you see often but rarely see executed well.  It may not be innovative or creative, but those looking for that should have known to go elsewhere.  We love classic French food so we were in for a treat. They start you out with a warm sliced baguette and ours was served with a delicious salmon mousse.  Yum!  Our order:\\n\\nFrench Onion Soup - $8.  The all time classic and done quite well here.  It was a special and has a perfect ratio of cheese to bread to broth.  Served piping hot, it was savory and warming. While many versions are super sized or too salty or filled with excessive cheese or bread (nearby Joannie's), this bowl is a testament to restraint and skill.  \\n\\nLobster Bisque - $10.  A mainstay of the menu, the lobster bisque is great as well. We found several chunks of lobster tail and a creamy and rich broth. It's well balanced and tasty.\\n\\nEscargots De Bourgogne -$10.  We haven't had escargot in awhile and locally the last time was probably the excellent Bistro Moulin in Monterey.  The ones here were fresh, drenched in butter and garlic and so aromatic.  Fun to eat though we had a Pretty Woman moment as one shell slipped away due to our clumsiness.\\n\\nCoq Au Vin De Chanturge - $18 Another mainstay of their menu and executed very well.  Super tender chicken marinated with wine and with shallots, bacon and mushrooms.  The accompanying vegetables, mashed potatoes, and carrots are old school but fresh and delicious.\\n\\nFilet De Boef Au Pouive De Madagascar - $31. I rarely order filet mignon as I prefer the flavorful ribeye over the more tender filet.  Nonetheless, I had heard several raves and I'm glad I listened.  The key is the wonderful peppercorn sauce but just as important is the perfect medium rare preparation.  So tender, so flavorful.  I wiped off every last drop of the sauce and finished all my mashed potatoes.\\n\\nOverall, we left both full and happy.  The hostess (wife of the owner) was friendly and engaging throughout and even shared both a wine toast for the restaurant's 25th anniversary and our special occasion as well as an after dinner glass of port though we had skipped desserts to order at our next stop - a thoughtful and nice touch.\\n\\nWhen a restaurant has been around for 25 years, they clearly are doing something right, especially in light of other places turning over frequently.  Special thanks to Local S. for providing a thoughtful review when I was researching whether to dine here. It was the right choice!\\n\\nLe Petit Bistro accepts credit cards including American Express.\", u'Great food! Great service!\\n\\nLooking forward to more visits when here from Tennessee!!', u\"Small, dimly-lit French restaurant with an intimate atmosphere. It's REALLY quiet in here, almost to the point where you feel a little awkward talking at a normal level...\\n\\nParking:\\nPrivate parking lot located in the back of the restaurant or street parking.\\n\\nService:\\nOur server wasn't particularly friendly, however, the bus service was attentive.\\n\\nFood:\\n- Lobster bisque - Lobster reduction with lobster pieces. We saw many other people in the restaurant ordering this, so we thought it would be good. We were wrong. It was nothing special. The soup was a little spicy, and there weren't very many lobster pieces in the bisque.\\n- Filet of Sole with Vegetables and Rice - One of the specials for the night (presented on an iPad). They gave a large portion of fish, which was soft, but the sauce didn't really stand out. Vegetables included some cucumber slivers, carrots, green beans, and squash. There was an incredibly small amount of rice on my plate.\\n- Tarte Tatin - Caramelized apple pie with whipped cream. This was not good at all. It did not come out warm and tasted like they got it out of a box from the market's freezer aisle. For $7.00 this was not worth it at all!\\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't return here. Prices are steep for the food you receive, and the menu, in general, is pretty limited. Also, the food lacked in quality. This is not what I would have expected from a $$$ French restaurant.\", u\"Delicious, simple French food without the pretentious French attitude! Usually I'd associate a French restaurant with $$$$, reservations required and waiters turning their noses up at you because you didn't care for the single course consisting of a sole hunk of bleu cheese, but Le Petit Bistro has none of that. The food is not overly complicated, but beautifully executed and ever so tasty. Most of their entrees are simple dishes like Coq au Vin, almond crusted salmon, lamb chops, or a filet mignon. On a recent visit, I had the almond crusted salmon and the almonds gave the fish a really great texture. Served with a simple side of stemmed veggies and mashed potatoes and I really felt like I was dining in someone's cozy little French home.\\n\\nOther dishes I've tried that I really liked are the scallops, sweet bread, and lamb chops. Their menu is pretty small, although they have daily specials on a chalkboard (or displayed on an iPad brought to your table). I will say that the one thing I truly look forward to eating is the Duck Pate, which was the closest to foie gras you could get during the Foie Gras Prohibition Era. It's definitely no foie; it's still got a liver-y ofal-ness to it, but I love it and I request extra bread to spread it onto and devour.\\n\\nI've only had the chocolate mousse for dessert, but it's very decadent and is almost like a dark chocolate mousse. Not powerfully sweet.\\n\\nReservations usually not required unless it's Valentine's Weekend. On the Friday afteroon before Valentine's, I was able to secure a table for 8:00pm although I did see a few walk-in's at the same time. Otherwise, this place is never super packed, but there are definitely regulars and lots of fans at this place. Bon Appetit!\", u\"I don't come here that often, but I find something new & tasty every time I come here.\", u\"Le petit bistro is a classy, cozy French restaurant that is easy to miss on El Camino Real.  I will not call it a hidden gem, but it is good food at a value price.  \\nWe started with the snails - VERY good - must try, very tender and perfect texture&flavor\\nLobster Tartare - minced lobster in a puff pastry, tasty complexion and good choice\\nLobster Bisque - I do not recommend, I personally didn't like it (not very unique flavors, couldn't taste the lobster)\\n\\nEntrees - rib eye steak (special) - portions are slightly large, they gave me about a 16 oz. steak, huge transition from the miniature appetizers; however the steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the mushroom sauce was nice\\nLamb chops - a little too chewy, good portions, overall a pretty good dish\\n\\nDessert - only tried the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e, which as expected was delicious, good burnt sugar top.\\n\\nService - 4 star, the only flaw was that the food came out a little slow, the meal took about 2 hours, but the waiters were patient and kind.\\n\\nOverall, Le Petit Bistro is a nice little French place with good food, worth stopping by, but not worth going out of your way to try.\", u'Excellent restaurant. The service is good, the food is delicious. I came with a few friends and everyone enjoyed the food. One of the best French restaurants in the Bay! I recommend!!', u'Exactly what a bistro should be - do a few things, but do them right. Everything we had - Lobster Bisque, Duck Liver Pate (a kind of liver not yet outlawed in California), Lamb Chops, Pork Medaillons, and Roasted Duck - were excellent. All of these are simple dishes; but it is a simple ones which are most difficult, since you cannot cover up mistakes by clever presentation or heavy sauce. I did have a small disagreement with Jean-Michel about which books should be on display - I tried to convince him to add \"Asterix\" to otherwise distinguished company of La Fontaine fables, and he even made a verbal agreement to do so (we did not shake on it, or took a blood oath, so I can\\'t blame him if he does not). Also, the waitress brought my son \"port\" instead of \"fork\" - not exactly a disagreeable mistake, easily corrected by explicitly asking for \"fourchette\"\\n\\nAs for prices - quite commensurate with the quality, so was a happy meal altogether', u\"Standard fare with good execution and a nice atmosphere. This is not somewhere you go for some newfangled creative fusion cuisine, but rather if you want some classic fresh bistro dishes prepared well. We had the duck, lamb, and pork with the pork probably being my favorite, though this is not to say I didn't like the other dishes either.\", u'Private and quiet atmosphere, make you feel home. Service is wonderful and warm. The roasted duck is amazing, crispy outside while tender inside. Lobster appetizer is also out of expectation', u\"As the name of the establishment suggests, this place is a very small bistro.  From the outside, this place looks like a dive but once inside, it is charming.  The menu is very limited and doesn't seem to change.  I'm a big fan of their pate and mussels appetizers.  I don't care for escargot but people I dined with really enjoyed it.  My favorite entr\\xe9e is the duck which is cooked two ways.  It is served with a sauce that is slightly sweet and delicious.  I recently tried the lamb chops which I didn't care for too much.  It seemed to be lightly breaded and fried.  Their desserts are good.  Overall their portions are generous and reasonably priced.\\n\\nWhen the place isn't busy, the service is good.  But as soon as it gets busy, service degrades very quickly.  When I feel like having some duck, this place is on my short list.\", u'Had a wonderful experience there! The lobster bisque was my favorite dish. The Demi canard was also excellent, succulent with nice blend of sweetness and savory. The selection of wines are solid. We had a large group and the service was attentive.', u\"Last night was the second time my boyfriend and I have been to Le Petit Bistro and both times we've loved it; he's from France and it's not often anything truly impresses him.\\n\\nBoth times we've gotten the lobster bisque and it's been spot on. This time we also ordered:\\n- lobster tartlette\\n- almond crusted salmon\\n- rack of lamb\\n- escargot\\n- creme brulee\\n-chocolate mousse\\n- a bottle saint emilion 2011 reverence\\n\\nThe owner, staff, and general service are impeccable and the food is delicious -- instead of fancy SF portions (read: small) you actually get a filling amount of food for pretty darn good prices. Not cheap enough to be our regular place for a weekly dinner but definitive worth going to once a month of so.\", u'The almond crusted salmon with bearnaise sauce is OMFG.  You get 3 different textures and 3 flavors, it\\'s perfection.  Most cooked salmon is usually quite firm.  However this was practically butterfish.  Wonderful.  They should just put it on their main menu.\\n\\nI also feed the lobster bisque to our baby, who says \"NNGGGHHH!!\" every time he gets a spoonful.', u'C\\'est magnifique!! What a wonderful evening we had last night at this lovely little place on El Camino.. Food and service are both absolutely 5-star and pricing is very decent!! We started off with their ognion soup and vinaigrette salad.. Excellent quality and a true French taste (I know, because I spent quite a few years traveling to Paris once every month). Our main courses were the \"coq au vin\" and filet mignon; both cooked to perfection!! We topped it all of with the amazing chocolate mousse! We are so happy to have found this lovely little place. Truly a little piece of Paris in The Valley!! Will be back soon!!', u'I had been wanting to try Le Petit Bistro for a few years now, and have driven past it for most of my lifetime. It\\'s one of those places that you barely even notice, as you drive by on El Camino, yet it\\'s been there the entire time. With such a long history, you know that it has to be good!\\n\\nAs far as service and food go, it was great! Our server was very attentive from the moment we walked in. But I would have to say that what turned me off was that the restaurant has a stench of old that I couldn\\'t get over. I don\\'t know if it\\'s in the carpet or seeped into the wood, and while it could add character to the business, it does remind you that the business has been there for a long time. Some people can get over it, others can\\'t. I would love to take my parents to try the food, but I know that they wouldn\\'t last 30 seconds in there.\\n\\nIf you\\'re one who can get past that, then...\\n*You can make a reservation\\n*If you get there too early in the evening, my reservation was at 6pm, the restaurant was empty, and there wasn\\'t enough ambient noise for my friend and I to chat in, without being shusshed\". It wasn\\'t a problem an hour later\\n*The servers use an ipad to show you the daily specials, so you don\\'t have to strain your eyes, looking across the room at the blackboard\\n\\nSo my girl friend and I ordered:\\n* Lobster tartlettes\\n* Lamb Chops\\n* Roast Duck\\n* Creme brulee\\n\\nWhile French food isn\\'t served family style, both entrees were perfect to split. Everything was well prepared, and delicious. It\\'s everything that you would expect in a French restaurant.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this place may not be calling out my name, the next time I\\'m looking for French food.', u'Great little french restaurant. Most dishes are very good. The baked scallop is excellent. Duck parfait qualities vary. Sometimes a bit undercooked. Escargot is fine. Sword fish, if they have it, is excellent as well. Always busy. Need reservation most of the times.', u\"This is my favorite restaurant I would eat out at with good friends. I live walking distance from here, comfortably quiet enough for deep conversation. Good for locals, but not sure if it's worth driving long distance here. So 5 stars are totally my point of view, and I'd be glad if you also think so.\\n\\nIt is on El Camino Real and it's confusing to find the parking lot, because the sign says Danish Concepts parking. Just get in there and you'll find parking lot inside.\\n\\nI feel very comfortable like at home here, very warm atmosphere inside. The Madame recognizes me and welcomes me in addictive French accent. The food is always good enough. It's not uncomfortably super delicious, so my stomach isn't so surprised but well satisfied.\\n\\nOverall, I feel great having food here. Not because of a single reason, but all of them together, good friends, warm atmosphere, great real conversation, comfortable food, addictive madame's voice, wine selections. Other customers look happy, too. What could be better than this? Have tasty food here with good friends to talk with, (optional alcohol) and be happy!\\n\\nThe price looks reasonable. You might receive the bill charging you more than you expect if you're like me, because you'll order dessert, another glass of wine, coffee and more, more, because of the comfort.\", u'Traditional classic French bistro dishes, well balanced flavors and very good portions.  Prices are reasonable. For appetizer, we tried the special lobster tartes in pastry shells followed with duck orange and lamb chops entrees.  All food are well prepared, we enjoyed the quiet atmosphere as well.', u\"Small place, with a lovely atmosphere and friendly service.\\n\\nThe menu has a few dishes that are French 'classics' (in my mind).  They are all done well enough, with reasonable prices and good portions, however nothing really stood out as 'amazing', but I don't think that is what it is trying to achieve.\\n\\nThese seem like French 'comfort' foods in an intimate setting.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems like a great place for locals to fulfill some French Cravings or for a casual date.\", u\"Very quaint!  This restaurant is small and has a limited menu, but has a lovely, romantic ambiance to it.  It's dimly lit and not very loud, perfect for small conversations with your significant other or companion.\\n\\nWe had the... Mousse de Foie de Canard (duck liver pate with cornichon), Medallions de Porc aux Champignons (medallions of tenderlion pork with mushroom demi-glace), and Filet De Boeuf Au Poivre De Madagascar (filet mignon with cognac and green peppercorn sauce).\\n\\nPate was nomsy!  There was a pretty, healthy portion of pate over a bed of pickled veggies, cabbage, olives, and pickles.  The different veggies complimented the pate well!  Loved the contrast in texture and taste!  It also paired well with the bread we had on the side.  That spread thing that came with the bread was also NOMSY!  I have no idea what it is though.  :c  Must ask next time I'm back!\\n\\nI wasn't too big of a fan of the pork though, a bit dry but was much more moist with the mushroom glaze it was sitting in.  The filet mignon was cooked nicely medium rare and was very, very tender.  Again, it was also sitting in a very rich, flavorful sauce making both entrees very, very rich in flavor.  The potato and veggies on the side of both entrees were all very simple, but tasty!  \\n\\nWe wanted to try the crepe special that night, but they unfortunately ran out.  We were disappointed, but they made it up and gave us a creme brulee on the house!  So nice of them!  Service was exceptional and the ladies were so, soooooo sweet and helpful!\", u\"Small quiet place. They don't have too many options. We went for a team dinner. Not exactly a fun place, but on the plus side, since it was quiet, we could have great conversations.\\n\\nThe food was good. I had the days special halibut. Very well cooked with sublime flavors.\", u\"Came here for my 9th years anniversary, it was quite an experience , all the hosts and servers are French and they all have that lovely French accent . Our server was a sweet blonde woman who was always attentive.  in fact the chef forgot about my order and we ended up not having any bread or appetizer for 24 minutes but I didn't know bc the server was so friendly and I thought that service was suppose to be slow here , well that wasn't the case, our server immediately tells us the problem and offered us complimentary desserts , 2 desserts dishes ! If that isn't great service I don't know what is\\n\\nAtmosphere  - ****dark, intimate yet cozy / interesting mix I know. The lightning is very dim and the restaurant is small , There's Van Gogh, Picasso and of course monet paintings on the wall and candle light on every table\\n\\nBasket bread - **** really good bread but I'm not surprised\\n\\nAppetizer - ***** escargot  ! Definitely my favorite part of the meal , it was hot, savory and I swear the garlic and butter literally melt within your mouth\\n\\nEntrees\\n\\nFilet mignon- ***quite flavorful but not as tender as I imagine it to be\\n\\nCrispy duck -**** I love duck! The meat was dark and flavorful, skin is quite crispy and the sauce gives and sweet and salty balance to each bite I endeavor\\n\\nDesserts\\n\\nCreme br\\xfbl\\xe9e  -***** oh my the the richness of its taste is still melting in my mouth\\n\\nCrepe- ** eh not that great, crepe was to thick and fruits is way too sour\\n\\nWine ****\\nWhy am I allergic to sulfite? My husband loves the wine\", u\"This place is pretty hard to notice, as it's located in an old building on El Camino, but don't judge the inside based on the outside. The staff is incredibly friendly and the overall decor is homey and intimate.\\n\\nI had the feuillette and the Mousse de Chocolat, and both were great. The portions are very reasonable and in an acceptable price range.\\n\\nAlso, there isn't a lot of parking in the back, so be prepared for that.\", u'Took my wife here for our anniversary. Best authentic French in the Bay Area. We ordered: lobster soup, French onion soup, duck liver, mussel, and half a duck. My favorite is the lobster soup. I would come here just to taste the lobster soup. Fair pricing for the high quality meal and service. A++', u'Great food, great service, and ambiance.   Will defiantly recommend the place and go back again.', u'We went here for our Anniversary (lots of coordination getting the parents to watch and put the kids down) so was hoping for a wonderful experience (given the reviews and recommendation from friends)\\n\\nSadly, that may have set our expectations too high...  \\n\\nTLDR: food was decent, nice ambiance, however, they missed small touches that would\\'ve bumped my review to 4 stars - things such as not even mentioning of our anniversary and and a disengaged waitress\\n\\nOur order:\\n*lobster bisque - pretty good, several pieces of lobster\\n*french onion soup - good, but not the best I\\'ve had\\n*crispy duck - portions were decent and the duck was quite tasty\\n*lamb shank - was ok, nothing to write home about\\n*mashed potatoes (side on both entrees) meh - felt like something I\\'ve had from an all you can eat kind of place\\n*grand marnier cheesecake w/ fruit & melba sauce - decent interpretation of the cheesecake and flavor.  Unfortunately, I had to eat it all since the alcohol wasn\\'t cooked off as the waitress said it was.  \\n*water only\\n\\n+\\'s:\\n*quick and easy online reservations, was able to make a comment that we were celebrating our anniversary\\n\\n*did not notice an \\'old\\' odor (in several other reviews), the yummy smells from the kitchen were noticed in the parking lot!\\n\\n*reasonable pricing from a French restaurant\\n\\n*bread was excellent (warm/recently toasted), crunch crust and soft middle.  Had enough flavor to stand on it\\'s own without needing to use the butter spread (which was also good)\\n\\n*host was nice and pleasant, was given our choice of where to sit, we chose to be near the kitchen, we kind of like sitting near the action\\n\\n*water cup never went below the 50% mark\\n\\n-\\'s\\n*no ipads for us (used to display the specials), so I had to ask a few times what the specials were (poor dad memory, what can I say)\\n\\n*waitress was so-so, sadly she seemed too busy to not really care about our table, it was almost as if we had to ask for the next step of the meal (questions about the menu, we received no recommendations on what to order, didn\\'t really seem to care to serve us).  When we got to the dessert phase - she didn\\'t know what melba sauce was when we asked and didn\\'t really know how some of the desserts were prepared (whether the alcohol was cooked off on the cheesecake, she said it was, but when we got it, the alcohol was not cooked off...).  When we asked about the melba sauce, the response was \"I don\\'t eat sugar\" didn\\'t even offer to go find out for us... so I just looked it up myself.  \\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s too much to expect from a service point of view as I\\'ve dined at similar priced restaurants and received much better service.  Might have just been an off day for that person, a different waitress took our picture seemed to have a bit more engagement and the bus staff was attentive.\\n\\n*nothing celebratory about our dining experience for our anniversary (despite me mentioning it during the reservation process, I know they do things for people celebrating since I saw another table get a dessert with a candle it it)\\n\\nBottom line, if friends wanted to go here to eat I would dine there with them, but I won\\'t be seeking this restaurant out.  I don\\'t think I\\'d bring my 2 kids here, not the right setting.  IF you are bringing kids you may want to call in advance to make sure they have enough high chairs (I only saw one, in the mens/womens shared bathroom)', u'Good escargots, not exactly how I love them but probably still the best I had over here.\\nThe coq au vin was pretty good.\\n\\nThe best feature of this restaurant, is by far its humbleness.\\nFor once french food is not over priced and not pretentious.', u\"Went to the place for a field trip. The food was not as amazing as expected from my French teacher telling us that French food is complete on a difference level than American food. Over all it was a good meal. Portions are small so order more than one entree if you usually eat a lot. I have the beef and chocolate moose for dessert. It was pretty good. If you are looking for a romantic place to bring you're girlfriend and have a different vibe. This is the place. Prices are little expensive tho\", u\"I would recommend this place to anyone in that area. I have been there twice and both times were for a business trip (I couldn't wait to go back the second time).\\n\\nI got the pork medallions both times once with the French onion soup which was amazing and once with the mussels which were also very good.\\n\\nThey also have a great local wine selection and I almost forgot to mention that even there water is good. Instead of lemon they put a tad bit of orange, barely enough to notice but it was tasty refreshing and different.\\n\\nI will be coming back anytime I'm in the area for sure.\", u'Not bad but I don\\'t think it\\'s worthy of a return visit either. Our party ordered most of the menu: for the apps, escargot, pate, lobster in phyllo shells, and a couple salads.\\nThe escargot was pretty good-- the pesto added a nice flavor to the snails. Otherwise, the apps were pretty mediocre at best. Avoid the pate, it was not very good at all.\\nThe salads consist of iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes: nothing special.\\n\\nFor the entrees, the filet and sole were probably our favorites. The filet was in a Demi glac\\xe9 that really enhanced the flavor. It came with some mashed potatoes and green beans that add some variety. The bread they provided also paired well with the sauce.\\n\\nThe fish entrees were flavorful, just not overly plenteous. The lamb chop was very large but had a little too much gamey flavor for my liking.\\n\\nThe service was all right-- they definitely take pride in their \"French\" style. So much so that when we opted for no dessert and asked for the check soon after we finished our dishes, it appeared that our server was moderately offended. They are definitely used to people coming and killing several hours along with drinking plenty of wine.', u'This is our go-to place for birthdays, celebrations, and big life events. We always get top service, and walk away comfortably full from a wonderful meal. Not sure why someone commented that the wine list is limited. It is HUGE! They also do simple cocktails, like my favorite, Kir Royale.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is dimly lit, romantic. Perfect for a couple although there are sometimes families or business dinners too.\\n\\nI have NEVER had bad food or bad service here, and have been a loyal customer for over 10 years.', u\"So I went here a year ago and I still think about my meal.  For me, I write a lot of nice things about most food that just basically tastes good or is clever or I like.  I am a simple foodie, its very clear to me bad food is bad, good food is good.  But then......there is a place like this where I thought I knew what flavor was, where I thought I'd eaten good food......and then you know with the first bite you are in a different stratosphere of elegant and cultured food.\\n\\nFirst of all, as a vegetarian I did struggle here. There was nothing on the menu I wanted to eat (because I am ONE OF THOSE vegetarians - the picky one who doesn't like eggplant, spinach or mushrooms......sigh. Life would be so much easier if I did).  So the actual one vegetarian item on the menu I couldn't eat that night.\\n\\nHowever, I explained my situation to the server and she worked with the chef to give me an extra large plate of vegetables that pretty much blew my mind.  The subtle flavors, the herbs, the delicacy of effort was totally amazing.  I have never eaten a meal that perfect that made me feel like I was on one of those food shows or something.\\n\\nMaybe I don't get out enough too.  However, I do really hop around a lot of local restaurants and have tried many things both in the US and abroad, and this meal was truly special.  I think about it a lot, and though I haven't had an opportunity to return yet I am going to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my meal when I do and that is a wonderful palate pleasing heart feeling.\\n\\nSince I was just thinking about the meal again today, and happened to be on Yelp to write (finally, thanks to a sleeping baby) I needed to pour out some love to this place.\", u\"How did I miss this little gem for all these years? And this was just when I thought I was bored of Mountain View's offerings. I loved EVERYTHING from the food to the ambiance to the service. I even stayed for dessert. Prices were reasonable. Dinner for two, dessert, and a couple of glasses of wine came out to around 130 bucks. I can't speak to the wine list because I ordered by the glass, which was their house Salmon Creek, I believe.\\n\\nFrom the outside, it doesn't look like much but don't let the exterior fool you. There is no music, which suited me just fine as the tables were all filled and there was a pleasant buzz of conversation so it didn't feel awkward.\\n\\nMy family usually dines at La Foret in Almaden Valley so I'll definitely recommend they try this place and you should too!\", u\"This spot has been on our favorites list for a long time.  Jean Michelle has been serving great, traditional French Cuisine for years.  Love the Lobster Bisque and the Duck, no wait, the Rack of lamb... or the Filet.  The Coquille...  \\nMasterful simplicity...\\nEvery time I'm in the Bay Area we find an excuse to go there.  This brand of French  tradition has become a lost art.\", u\"Solid 3.5 stars. (Rounded up.)\\n\\nIt seems pretty rare these days to find a charming bistro that offers an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are dining in a small town in France.\\nThe restaurant is dimly lit. You will find yourself surrounded by oil paintings and books to make you feel as if you were dining in the comfort someone's home.\\n\\nGreeted as you enter in french, the service was on point and delightfully cheery. Staff was kind and attentive. (Note, we did arrive before the dinner crowd.)\\n\\nThe food was good, standard french fare executed just right. No frills, just good bistro dining. There is also a list of daily specials.\\n\\nA perk offered at this establishment is their salmon spread which provides a unique experience to the normal butter fare. It's delightful! Bread comes out warm. They are very generous in offering seconds before the need to ask.\\n\\nOver all, it's a hidden gem nestled in on El Camino Real.\\n\\nWhat you need to know:\\n\\n- Parking is around the back in the same lot with Danish Concepts\\n- Complimentary bread and salmon spread\\n- Most of the staff speaks french\\n- You may ask for your soup to be split\", u'This is a great place with some authentic french food and friendly staff. Pretty good selection of wines. Had the French onion soup and the entr\\xe9e of Portobello mushrooms in a puff pastry. Chocolat mousse for dessert was excellent too.\\nGreat for dates and small groups.', u\"I really, really really want to love Le Petit Bistro, it has all the potential to be a 5 star restaurant but fell ever so short.\\n\\nThe 5 stars could have been earned on the food alone. Which I mean, is why you go to a restaurant anyway, right? Everything my boyfriend, brother and I ate was excellent.\\n\\nFor starters my brother chose the French onion soup - classically made with the distinct tastes that make you feel at home, the boyfriend went with lobster bisque - creamy and delicious, and I opted for the duck pate - equally creamy and delicious.\\n\\nFor the main course I went with the filet mignon, served in a cognac and green peppercorn sauce, the dish was exceptional. While I requested the meat to be cooked to medium it was quite red (not pink, red) for my liking however it had the taste and consistency of melted butter, so no complaints there!\\n\\nWhere the restaurant fell short was in the service and the atmosphere. Extremely small and what could be very cozy ended up feeling tight and wedged in as more and more dinner guests arrived. By small I literally mean there were under 20 tables, maybe even under 15. And with all tables seated the wait staff was visibly struggling to keep up. I almost felt bad for how many times I requested water but I felt less and less bad as time went on and that request was ignored repeatedly.\\n\\nAgain since the restaurant was quite small the setting felt like it should be intimate however with no music playing there was an awkward hushed din across the restaurant, making it difficult to really hold a conversation. Pump in some classical French music, et voil\\xe0 - you would have a perfectly romantic setting.\\n\\nI felt Le Petit Bistro was fairly priced for their offerings, while on the slightly pricier side I wouldn't expect much less from a high quality French fare restaurant.\", u\"Their dishes taste like home-made food, with the same positive energy as you feel when eating your mom's cooking! The water they brought us was flavored with oranges as opposed to limes; this gave a very pleasant taste to water. So pleasant that I couldn't stop drinking water ;)\\nThe staff were very friendly too. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.\", u\"Update 6 years later, we are still fans of Le Petit Bistro,  the food is consistently delicious with great service.  It continues to be one of our go-to spots when we are looking for a nice meal without breaking the bank. Aside from the fact that is a great little restuarant,   the owner, Jean-Michel Peuvrelle  is a truly nice person, one Valentine's Day a few years ago, we had to cancel the day before because I had developed a bad cold.  We offered to pick it up as a  to-go order as I knew they were planning a special menu and probably had already purchased the food.  He said that was not necessary, and told my husband to come by to pick up some chicken stock for my cold, free of charge. Could not believe it, fans for life.\", u\"We had a truly enjoyable meal at Le Petit Bistro.  It was our first visit and I decided to drop by for a special occasion. While I had reservations at a Michelin star (All Spice for those curious), I was in the mood for something intimate, classic, and casual and Le Petit Bistro fit the bill perfectly.\\n\\nLocated off the busy El Camino Real, Le Petit Bistro is a long time institution to the area and the type of warm, friendly bistro I'd expect while visiting Carmel or Monterey.  The dining room is quiet and cozy but well staffed with a ma\\xeetre-d, a friendly hostess, servers and busboys.\\n\\nThe dimly lit restaurant is a nice oasis from the busy Bay Area and where others focus on an older and dated interior, we found a warm and inviting one.\\n\\nDaily specials are shared on an iPad (how's that for modern) but the menus contain all the classic French dishes you see often but rarely see executed well.  It may not be innovative or creative, but those looking for that should have known to go elsewhere.  We love classic French food so we were in for a treat. They start you out with a warm sliced baguette and ours was served with a delicious salmon mousse.  Yum!  Our order:\\n\\nFrench Onion Soup - $8.  The all time classic and done quite well here.  It was a special and has a perfect ratio of cheese to bread to broth.  Served piping hot, it was savory and warming. While many versions are super sized or too salty or filled with excessive cheese or bread (nearby Joannie's), this bowl is a testament to restraint and skill.  \\n\\nLobster Bisque - $10.  A mainstay of the menu, the lobster bisque is great as well. We found several chunks of lobster tail and a creamy and rich broth. It's well balanced and tasty.\\n\\nEscargots De Bourgogne -$10.  We haven't had escargot in awhile and locally the last time was probably the excellent Bistro Moulin in Monterey.  The ones here were fresh, drenched in butter and garlic and so aromatic.  Fun to eat though we had a Pretty Woman moment as one shell slipped away due to our clumsiness.\\n\\nCoq Au Vin De Chanturge - $18 Another mainstay of their menu and executed very well.  Super tender chicken marinated with wine and with shallots, bacon and mushrooms.  The accompanying vegetables, mashed potatoes, and carrots are old school but fresh and delicious.\\n\\nFilet De Boef Au Pouive De Madagascar - $31. I rarely order filet mignon as I prefer the flavorful ribeye over the more tender filet.  Nonetheless, I had heard several raves and I'm glad I listened.  The key is the wonderful peppercorn sauce but just as important is the perfect medium rare preparation.  So tender, so flavorful.  I wiped off every last drop of the sauce and finished all my mashed potatoes.\\n\\nOverall, we left both full and happy.  The hostess (wife of the owner) was friendly and engaging throughout and even shared both a wine toast for the restaurant's 25th anniversary and our special occasion as well as an after dinner glass of port though we had skipped desserts to order at our next stop - a thoughtful and nice touch.\\n\\nWhen a restaurant has been around for 25 years, they clearly are doing something right, especially in light of other places turning over frequently.  Special thanks to Local S. for providing a thoughtful review when I was researching whether to dine here. It was the right choice!\\n\\nLe Petit Bistro accepts credit cards including American Express.\", u'Great food! Great service!\\n\\nLooking forward to more visits when here from Tennessee!!', u\"Small, dimly-lit French restaurant with an intimate atmosphere. It's REALLY quiet in here, almost to the point where you feel a little awkward talking at a normal level...\\n\\nParking:\\nPrivate parking lot located in the back of the restaurant or street parking.\\n\\nService:\\nOur server wasn't particularly friendly, however, the bus service was attentive.\\n\\nFood:\\n- Lobster bisque - Lobster reduction with lobster pieces. We saw many other people in the restaurant ordering this, so we thought it would be good. We were wrong. It was nothing special. The soup was a little spicy, and there weren't very many lobster pieces in the bisque.\\n- Filet of Sole with Vegetables and Rice - One of the specials for the night (presented on an iPad). They gave a large portion of fish, which was soft, but the sauce didn't really stand out. Vegetables included some cucumber slivers, carrots, green beans, and squash. There was an incredibly small amount of rice on my plate.\\n- Tarte Tatin - Caramelized apple pie with whipped cream. This was not good at all. It did not come out warm and tasted like they got it out of a box from the market's freezer aisle. For $7.00 this was not worth it at all!\\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't return here. Prices are steep for the food you receive, and the menu, in general, is pretty limited. Also, the food lacked in quality. This is not what I would have expected from a $$$ French restaurant.\", u\"Delicious, simple French food without the pretentious French attitude! Usually I'd associate a French restaurant with $$$$, reservations required and waiters turning their noses up at you because you didn't care for the single course consisting of a sole hunk of bleu cheese, but Le Petit Bistro has none of that. The food is not overly complicated, but beautifully executed and ever so tasty. Most of their entrees are simple dishes like Coq au Vin, almond crusted salmon, lamb chops, or a filet mignon. On a recent visit, I had the almond crusted salmon and the almonds gave the fish a really great texture. Served with a simple side of stemmed veggies and mashed potatoes and I really felt like I was dining in someone's cozy little French home.\\n\\nOther dishes I've tried that I really liked are the scallops, sweet bread, and lamb chops. Their menu is pretty small, although they have daily specials on a chalkboard (or displayed on an iPad brought to your table). I will say that the one thing I truly look forward to eating is the Duck Pate, which was the closest to foie gras you could get during the Foie Gras Prohibition Era. It's definitely no foie; it's still got a liver-y ofal-ness to it, but I love it and I request extra bread to spread it onto and devour.\\n\\nI've only had the chocolate mousse for dessert, but it's very decadent and is almost like a dark chocolate mousse. Not powerfully sweet.\\n\\nReservations usually not required unless it's Valentine's Weekend. On the Friday afteroon before Valentine's, I was able to secure a table for 8:00pm although I did see a few walk-in's at the same time. Otherwise, this place is never super packed, but there are definitely regulars and lots of fans at this place. Bon Appetit!\", u\"I don't come here that often, but I find something new & tasty every time I come here.\", u\"Le petit bistro is a classy, cozy French restaurant that is easy to miss on El Camino Real.  I will not call it a hidden gem, but it is good food at a value price.  \\nWe started with the snails - VERY good - must try, very tender and perfect texture&flavor\\nLobster Tartare - minced lobster in a puff pastry, tasty complexion and good choice\\nLobster Bisque - I do not recommend, I personally didn't like it (not very unique flavors, couldn't taste the lobster)\\n\\nEntrees - rib eye steak (special) - portions are slightly large, they gave me about a 16 oz. steak, huge transition from the miniature appetizers; however the steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the mushroom sauce was nice\\nLamb chops - a little too chewy, good portions, overall a pretty good dish\\n\\nDessert - only tried the creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e, which as expected was delicious, good burnt sugar top.\\n\\nService - 4 star, the only flaw was that the food came out a little slow, the meal took about 2 hours, but the waiters were patient and kind.\\n\\nOverall, Le Petit Bistro is a nice little French place with good food, worth stopping by, but not worth going out of your way to try.\", u'Excellent restaurant. The service is good, the food is delicious. I came with a few friends and everyone enjoyed the food. One of the best French restaurants in the Bay! I recommend!!', u'Exactly what a bistro should be - do a few things, but do them right. Everything we had - Lobster Bisque, Duck Liver Pate (a kind of liver not yet outlawed in California), Lamb Chops, Pork Medaillons, and Roasted Duck - were excellent. All of these are simple dishes; but it is a simple ones which are most difficult, since you cannot cover up mistakes by clever presentation or heavy sauce. I did have a small disagreement with Jean-Michel about which books should be on display - I tried to convince him to add \"Asterix\" to otherwise distinguished company of La Fontaine fables, and he even made a verbal agreement to do so (we did not shake on it, or took a blood oath, so I can\\'t blame him if he does not). Also, the waitress brought my son \"port\" instead of \"fork\" - not exactly a disagreeable mistake, easily corrected by explicitly asking for \"fourchette\"\\n\\nAs for prices - quite commensurate with the quality, so was a happy meal altogether', u\"Standard fare with good execution and a nice atmosphere. This is not somewhere you go for some newfangled creative fusion cuisine, but rather if you want some classic fresh bistro dishes prepared well. We had the duck, lamb, and pork with the pork probably being my favorite, though this is not to say I didn't like the other dishes either.\", u'Private and quiet atmosphere, make you feel home. Service is wonderful and warm. The roasted duck is amazing, crispy outside while tender inside. Lobster appetizer is also out of expectation', u\"As the name of the establishment suggests, this place is a very small bistro.  From the outside, this place looks like a dive but once inside, it is charming.  The menu is very limited and doesn't seem to change.  I'm a big fan of their pate and mussels appetizers.  I don't care for escargot but people I dined with really enjoyed it.  My favorite entr\\xe9e is the duck which is cooked two ways.  It is served with a sauce that is slightly sweet and delicious.  I recently tried the lamb chops which I didn't care for too much.  It seemed to be lightly breaded and fried.  Their desserts are good.  Overall their portions are generous and reasonably priced.\\n\\nWhen the place isn't busy, the service is good.  But as soon as it gets busy, service degrades very quickly.  When I feel like having some duck, this place is on my short list.\", u'Had a wonderful experience there! The lobster bisque was my favorite dish. The Demi canard was also excellent, succulent with nice blend of sweetness and savory. The selection of wines are solid. We had a large group and the service was attentive.', u\"Last night was the second time my boyfriend and I have been to Le Petit Bistro and both times we've loved it; he's from France and it's not often anything truly impresses him.\\n\\nBoth times we've gotten the lobster bisque and it's been spot on. This time we also ordered:\\n- lobster tartlette\\n- almond crusted salmon\\n- rack of lamb\\n- escargot\\n- creme brulee\\n-chocolate mousse\\n- a bottle saint emilion 2011 reverence\\n\\nThe owner, staff, and general service are impeccable and the food is delicious -- instead of fancy SF portions (read: small) you actually get a filling amount of food for pretty darn good prices. Not cheap enough to be our regular place for a weekly dinner but definitive worth going to once a month of so.\", u'The almond crusted salmon with bearnaise sauce is OMFG.  You get 3 different textures and 3 flavors, it\\'s perfection.  Most cooked salmon is usually quite firm.  However this was practically butterfish.  Wonderful.  They should just put it on their main menu.\\n\\nI also feed the lobster bisque to our baby, who says \"NNGGGHHH!!\" every time he gets a spoonful.', u'C\\'est magnifique!! What a wonderful evening we had last night at this lovely little place on El Camino.. Food and service are both absolutely 5-star and pricing is very decent!! We started off with their ognion soup and vinaigrette salad.. Excellent quality and a true French taste (I know, because I spent quite a few years traveling to Paris once every month). Our main courses were the \"coq au vin\" and filet mignon; both cooked to perfection!! We topped it all of with the amazing chocolate mousse! We are so happy to have found this lovely little place. Truly a little piece of Paris in The Valley!! Will be back soon!!', u'I had been wanting to try Le Petit Bistro for a few years now, and have driven past it for most of my lifetime. It\\'s one of those places that you barely even notice, as you drive by on El Camino, yet it\\'s been there the entire time. With such a long history, you know that it has to be good!\\n\\nAs far as service and food go, it was great! Our server was very attentive from the moment we walked in. But I would have to say that what turned me off was that the restaurant has a stench of old that I couldn\\'t get over. I don\\'t know if it\\'s in the carpet or seeped into the wood, and while it could add character to the business, it does remind you that the business has been there for a long time. Some people can get over it, others can\\'t. I would love to take my parents to try the food, but I know that they wouldn\\'t last 30 seconds in there.\\n\\nIf you\\'re one who can get past that, then...\\n*You can make a reservation\\n*If you get there too early in the evening, my reservation was at 6pm, the restaurant was empty, and there wasn\\'t enough ambient noise for my friend and I to chat in, without being shusshed\". It wasn\\'t a problem an hour later\\n*The servers use an ipad to show you the daily specials, so you don\\'t have to strain your eyes, looking across the room at the blackboard\\n\\nSo my girl friend and I ordered:\\n* Lobster tartlettes\\n* Lamb Chops\\n* Roast Duck\\n* Creme brulee\\n\\nWhile French food isn\\'t served family style, both entrees were perfect to split. Everything was well prepared, and delicious. It\\'s everything that you would expect in a French restaurant.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this place may not be calling out my name, the next time I\\'m looking for French food.', u'Great little french restaurant. Most dishes are very good. The baked scallop is excellent. Duck parfait qualities vary. Sometimes a bit undercooked. Escargot is fine. Sword fish, if they have it, is excellent as well. Always busy. Need reservation most of the times.', u\"This is my favorite restaurant I would eat out at with good friends. I live walking distance from here, comfortably quiet enough for deep conversation. Good for locals, but not sure if it's worth driving long distance here. So 5 stars are totally my point of view, and I'd be glad if you also think so.\\n\\nIt is on El Camino Real and it's confusing to find the parking lot, because the sign says Danish Concepts parking. Just get in there and you'll find parking lot inside.\\n\\nI feel very comfortable like at home here, very warm atmosphere inside. The Madame recognizes me and welcomes me in addictive French accent. The food is always good enough. It's not uncomfortably super delicious, so my stomach isn't so surprised but well satisfied.\\n\\nOverall, I feel great having food here. Not because of a single reason, but all of them together, good friends, warm atmosphere, great real conversation, comfortable food, addictive madame's voice, wine selections. Other customers look happy, too. What could be better than this? Have tasty food here with good friends to talk with, (optional alcohol) and be happy!\\n\\nThe price looks reasonable. You might receive the bill charging you more than you expect if you're like me, because you'll order dessert, another glass of wine, coffee and more, more, because of the comfort.\", u'Traditional classic French bistro dishes, well balanced flavors and very good portions.  Prices are reasonable. For appetizer, we tried the special lobster tartes in pastry shells followed with duck orange and lamb chops entrees.  All food are well prepared, we enjoyed the quiet atmosphere as well.', u\"Small place, with a lovely atmosphere and friendly service.\\n\\nThe menu has a few dishes that are French 'classics' (in my mind).  They are all done well enough, with reasonable prices and good portions, however nothing really stood out as 'amazing', but I don't think that is what it is trying to achieve.\\n\\nThese seem like French 'comfort' foods in an intimate setting.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems like a great place for locals to fulfill some French Cravings or for a casual date.\", u\"Very quaint!  This restaurant is small and has a limited menu, but has a lovely, romantic ambiance to it.  It's dimly lit and not very loud, perfect for small conversations with your significant other or companion.\\n\\nWe had the... Mousse de Foie de Canard (duck liver pate with cornichon), Medallions de Porc aux Champignons (medallions of tenderlion pork with mushroom demi-glace), and Filet De Boeuf Au Poivre De Madagascar (filet mignon with cognac and green peppercorn sauce).\\n\\nPate was nomsy!  There was a pretty, healthy portion of pate over a bed of pickled veggies, cabbage, olives, and pickles.  The different veggies complimented the pate well!  Loved the contrast in texture and taste!  It also paired well with the bread we had on the side.  That spread thing that came with the bread was also NOMSY!  I have no idea what it is though.  :c  Must ask next time I'm back!\\n\\nI wasn't too big of a fan of the pork though, a bit dry but was much more moist with the mushroom glaze it was sitting in.  The filet mignon was cooked nicely medium rare and was very, very tender.  Again, it was also sitting in a very rich, flavorful sauce making both entrees very, very rich in flavor.  The potato and veggies on the side of both entrees were all very simple, but tasty!  \\n\\nWe wanted to try the crepe special that night, but they unfortunately ran out.  We were disappointed, but they made it up and gave us a creme brulee on the house!  So nice of them!  Service was exceptional and the ladies were so, soooooo sweet and helpful!\", u\"Small quiet place. They don't have too many options. We went for a team dinner. Not exactly a fun place, but on the plus side, since it was quiet, we could have great conversations.\\n\\nThe food was good. I had the days special halibut. Very well cooked with sublime flavors.\", u\"Came here for my 9th years anniversary, it was quite an experience , all the hosts and servers are French and they all have that lovely French accent . Our server was a sweet blonde woman who was always attentive.  in fact the chef forgot about my order and we ended up not having any bread or appetizer for 24 minutes but I didn't know bc the server was so friendly and I thought that service was suppose to be slow here , well that wasn't the case, our server immediately tells us the problem and offered us complimentary desserts , 2 desserts dishes ! If that isn't great service I don't know what is\\n\\nAtmosphere  - ****dark, intimate yet cozy / interesting mix I know. The lightning is very dim and the restaurant is small , There's Van Gogh, Picasso and of course monet paintings on the wall and candle light on every table\\n\\nBasket bread - **** really good bread but I'm not surprised\\n\\nAppetizer - ***** escargot  ! Definitely my favorite part of the meal , it was hot, savory and I swear the garlic and butter literally melt within your mouth\\n\\nEntrees\\n\\nFilet mignon- ***quite flavorful but not as tender as I imagine it to be\\n\\nCrispy duck -**** I love duck! The meat was dark and flavorful, skin is quite crispy and the sauce gives and sweet and salty balance to each bite I endeavor\\n\\nDesserts\\n\\nCreme br\\xfbl\\xe9e  -***** oh my the the richness of its taste is still melting in my mouth\\n\\nCrepe- ** eh not that great, crepe was to thick and fruits is way too sour\\n\\nWine ****\\nWhy am I allergic to sulfite? My husband loves the wine\", u\"This place is pretty hard to notice, as it's located in an old building on El Camino, but don't judge the inside based on the outside. The staff is incredibly friendly and the overall decor is homey and intimate.\\n\\nI had the feuillette and the Mousse de Chocolat, and both were great. The portions are very reasonable and in an acceptable price range.\\n\\nAlso, there isn't a lot of parking in the back, so be prepared for that.\", u'Took my wife here for our anniversary. Best authentic French in the Bay Area. We ordered: lobster soup, French onion soup, duck liver, mussel, and half a duck. My favorite is the lobster soup. I would come here just to taste the lobster soup. Fair pricing for the high quality meal and service. A++', u'Great food, great service, and ambiance.   Will defiantly recommend the place and go back again.', u'We went here for our Anniversary (lots of coordination getting the parents to watch and put the kids down) so was hoping for a wonderful experience (given the reviews and recommendation from friends)\\n\\nSadly, that may have set our expectations too high...  \\n\\nTLDR: food was decent, nice ambiance, however, they missed small touches that would\\'ve bumped my review to 4 stars - things such as not even mentioning of our anniversary and and a disengaged waitress\\n\\nOur order:\\n*lobster bisque - pretty good, several pieces of lobster\\n*french onion soup - good, but not the best I\\'ve had\\n*crispy duck - portions were decent and the duck was quite tasty\\n*lamb shank - was ok, nothing to write home about\\n*mashed potatoes (side on both entrees) meh - felt like something I\\'ve had from an all you can eat kind of place\\n*grand marnier cheesecake w/ fruit & melba sauce - decent interpretation of the cheesecake and flavor.  Unfortunately, I had to eat it all since the alcohol wasn\\'t cooked off as the waitress said it was.  \\n*water only\\n\\n+\\'s:\\n*quick and easy online reservations, was able to make a comment that we were celebrating our anniversary\\n\\n*did not notice an \\'old\\' odor (in several other reviews), the yummy smells from the kitchen were noticed in the parking lot!\\n\\n*reasonable pricing from a French restaurant\\n\\n*bread was excellent (warm/recently toasted), crunch crust and soft middle.  Had enough flavor to stand on it\\'s own without needing to use the butter spread (which was also good)\\n\\n*host was nice and pleasant, was given our choice of where to sit, we chose to be near the kitchen, we kind of like sitting near the action\\n\\n*water cup never went below the 50% mark\\n\\n-\\'s\\n*no ipads for us (used to display the specials), so I had to ask a few times what the specials were (poor dad memory, what can I say)\\n\\n*waitress was so-so, sadly she seemed too busy to not really care about our table, it was almost as if we had to ask for the next step of the meal (questions about the menu, we received no recommendations on what to order, didn\\'t really seem to care to serve us).  When we got to the dessert phase - she didn\\'t know what melba sauce was when we asked and didn\\'t really know how some of the desserts were prepared (whether the alcohol was cooked off on the cheesecake, she said it was, but when we got it, the alcohol was not cooked off...).  When we asked about the melba sauce, the response was \"I don\\'t eat sugar\" didn\\'t even offer to go find out for us... so I just looked it up myself.  \\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s too much to expect from a service point of view as I\\'ve dined at similar priced restaurants and received much better service.  Might have just been an off day for that person, a different waitress took our picture seemed to have a bit more engagement and the bus staff was attentive.\\n\\n*nothing celebratory about our dining experience for our anniversary (despite me mentioning it during the reservation process, I know they do things for people celebrating since I saw another table get a dessert with a candle it it)\\n\\nBottom line, if friends wanted to go here to eat I would dine there with them, but I won\\'t be seeking this restaurant out.  I don\\'t think I\\'d bring my 2 kids here, not the right setting.  IF you are bringing kids you may want to call in advance to make sure they have enough high chairs (I only saw one, in the mens/womens shared bathroom)', u'Good escargots, not exactly how I love them but probably still the best I had over here.\\nThe coq au vin was pretty good.\\n\\nThe best feature of this restaurant, is by far its humbleness.\\nFor once french food is not over priced and not pretentious.', u\"Went to the place for a field trip. The food was not as amazing as expected from my French teacher telling us that French food is complete on a difference level than American food. Over all it was a good meal. Portions are small so order more than one entree if you usually eat a lot. I have the beef and chocolate moose for dessert. It was pretty good. If you are looking for a romantic place to bring you're girlfriend and have a different vibe. This is the place. Prices are little expensive tho\", u\"I would recommend this place to anyone in that area. I have been there twice and both times were for a business trip (I couldn't wait to go back the second time).\\n\\nI got the pork medallions both times once with the French onion soup which was amazing and once with the mussels which were also very good.\\n\\nThey also have a great local wine selection and I almost forgot to mention that even there water is good. Instead of lemon they put a tad bit of orange, barely enough to notice but it was tasty refreshing and different.\\n\\nI will be coming back anytime I'm in the area for sure.\", u'Not bad but I don\\'t think it\\'s worthy of a return visit either. Our party ordered most of the menu: for the apps, escargot, pate, lobster in phyllo shells, and a couple salads.\\nThe escargot was pretty good-- the pesto added a nice flavor to the snails. Otherwise, the apps were pretty mediocre at best. Avoid the pate, it was not very good at all.\\nThe salads consist of iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes: nothing special.\\n\\nFor the entrees, the filet and sole were probably our favorites. The filet was in a Demi glac\\xe9 that really enhanced the flavor. It came with some mashed potatoes and green beans that add some variety. The bread they provided also paired well with the sauce.\\n\\nThe fish entrees were flavorful, just not overly plenteous. The lamb chop was very large but had a little too much gamey flavor for my liking.\\n\\nThe service was all right-- they definitely take pride in their \"French\" style. So much so that when we opted for no dessert and asked for the check soon after we finished our dishes, it appeared that our server was moderately offended. They are definitely used to people coming and killing several hours along with drinking plenty of wine.', u'This is our go-to place for birthdays, celebrations, and big life events. We always get top service, and walk away comfortably full from a wonderful meal. Not sure why someone commented that the wine list is limited. It is HUGE! They also do simple cocktails, like my favorite, Kir Royale.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is dimly lit, romantic. Perfect for a couple although there are sometimes families or business dinners too.\\n\\nI have NEVER had bad food or bad service here, and have been a loyal customer for over 10 years.']"
